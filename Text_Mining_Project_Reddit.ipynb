Unfortunately Russian subrreddit is frozen, according to the information on the website, Reddit has quarantined subreddit r/Russia due to misinformation, as the internationally condemned Russian invasion of Ukraine continues into its sixth day. r/RussiaPolitics has also been quarantined, just days after it was created in order to host invasion-related discussions.\n",

The proof of concept is pretty much in things you use all the time. Namely computer communication protocols. \\n\\nIt’s a pipe. It’s the traveler’s speed is largely dictated by the input and output speeds. The output rate happens to be fairly easy to increase by having the tunnel exit into multiple exit lanes. I.e. if cars start jamming in a tunnel build more places for the cars to unload. Rather than have four unload lanes have 8, and you’ve effectively doubled its output rate. If cars come in every 30s, but it takes 60s to unload passengers and free up the lanes you only need 2 lanes to ensure that you have no backups. Add in a buffer of maybe 5 unloading lanes and you have a very small chance of ever having a traffic build up on the output. \\n\\nThus really the biggest limiting reagent for traveling speeds is the loading time. Which likely isn’t going to be that big. It can be reduced by adding more tunnels, longer cars, etc., but I just don’t really see that as being that big of a wait. Definitely not longer than the wait for a subway or the wait for a ride service + traffic. \\n\\nOnce the cars are in the tunnel, they can travel virtually as fast as possible (obviously some limitations for safety reasons) in a straight line. This makes the travel much quicker than on a road above the surface. A self driving car (which is the end goal here), should be able to drive a straight line quickly and safely, fairly easily. \\n\\nAs it is Tesla’s self driving feature appears safer than human driver’s, but it seems like they’re still waiting on using the self driving feature for the boring tunnels. In a couple of years I’d assume it would be implemented and the speeds could probably be increased. \\n\\nAs for comparing it to the modes of transport. The cost in Vegas is cheaper than an Uber/Lyft ride to the passenger, and likely quicker. Compared to a subway, the cost of building the tunnel and the cars is at least a whole order of magnitude cheaper. It also takes several years fewer. I also think it would be nicer to take a self contained car than be out in public with a bunch of strangers on a subway, but that’s just me. \\n\\nLogistically it’s not perfect yet, but it does have some unique advantages over other forms of transportation.

If the satellite listened in all directions, it would still hear the directed signal from the user terminal, and it would use things like specific frequency bands to filter out any other random noise it picks up (unless that noise was very loud and broad spectrum, like a jammer).\\n\\nSo I was speculating that if the listening end of things is not directional, it would make it easier to jam because the jamming antenna wouldn\\'t need to be in a specific location in between the ground terminal and satellite.  As long as the receiving antenna could pick up the jamming signal from somewhere in its field of view, if it is overwhelmingly stronger than the Starlink transmit signal (which would be easy to do as the signals from the ground terminals and satellites are both relatively weak), I\\'d think it could be jammed.\\n\\nBut, I am not an RF or antenna expert so I may well be missing something here.', \"SpaceX can launch them faster than they get shot down.

However, a directed beam with something like a parabolic antenna goes much further and is extremely unlikely to jam without specifically targeting it, or being in between the receiver than the transmitter. The same amount of power that would connect devices 100 meters on an omnidirectional antenna would easily go 20 miles on a parabolic antenna. Starlink terminals don’t have to be powerful if the beam is directed well. On top of that, there’s not one receiver but a whole constellation of moving satellites.

Just not with taxpayers money, use his own money, Mars on!\", 'Mars has a completely different climate to Earth’s and does not support life. You would have to fully replicate the environmental conditions under which humans and the ecosystems upon which it depends can survive and prosper. Smarter people recognize that this is an impossibly deep challenge, even on a very small scale, requiring vast resources and tech that doesn’t exist outside of fiction. To believe that colonizing Mars is a realizable or worthy alternative to living on a planet that we as a species have specifically adapted to over millions of years is folly. It is a folly borne of sci-fi fantasies and techno-optimism run amok. Think about it for a second, how can we expect to relocate civilization to a barren, irradiated planet when we struggle to cope with or exert any control against Earth’s changing climate?\\n\\nBtw, Musk brands himself as a smart guy but he did not personally design any of his companies’ tech and at most he is a very talented swindler. Feel free to provide any proof to the contrary.', 'Damn right, I’m betting on the guy that reaches for the impossible and misses half the time instead of the ones sitting in the corner saying it won’t happen.\\n\\nThose people are the reason we don’t have hover boards in 2022.\\n\\nHe’s different for sure but one of the few with his skill set and drive that is actually trying to do some good in the world, rather than just fucking off to a private island.', 'Tesla vehicles are not even close to self-driving so let’s be clear on that. Musk has marketed the driver assistance software as equivalent or almost as good as FSD, which it plainly is not. Developing FSD tech at an acceptable level of reliability is incredibly difficult and possibly infeasible. Even so, Tesla’s ‘self-driving’ capabilities are demonstrably weak compared to other driverless tech (Google’s autonomous driving software was better and they had the integrity not to bring it to market because of its inherent limitations & dangers).\\n\\nTesla is also most definitely not mass market. It is a brand of luxury vehicle with serious reliability issues. Making cars serviceable, long-lasting, and reliable for everyday, long-term use is far more challenging than anything Tesla has accomplished technologically, and Tesla cars are notoriously troublesome to maintain or repair because that’s not what they are designed for.\\n\\nI’ll grant that SpaceX has done some legitimate work, even if Musk lied to investors about his rockets being cheaper (they are now the most expensive). The notion that interplanetary colonization is on the horizon, however, is not something even worth betting on - it’s a sci-fi dream that if realized would be disastrous. Humans can barely control Earth’s environment and we are biologically entwined with it. Mars is a barren, alien planet that cannot support human life and no single company, let alone one run by Musk, is going to manufacture an artificial environment with all of the intricate requirements for existence we take for granted on Earth. That would be ludicrous to expect. But Musk makes money by selling dreams that appeal to Silicon Valley types and other hapless tech enthusiasts, then profiting from the hype. His businesses are frequently on the brink of bankruptcy and every time it is he makes dishonest promises that rake in speculative capital and government subsidies.

Good for him , This is truly the way. \\n\\nThe world will truly never forget those who helped and those who didn’t. , Hyperloop in action , As someone, who has pooped on most things Elon, this is really great to see. Congratulations and a sincere thank you to Elon, Starlink, SpaceX, Ukraine, and everyone who made this happen! , Never thought I’d say this: “Thanks Elon!” , I know it\\'s not feasible but I *so* wanted the Starlink terminals to be delivered by a SpaceX rocket that sets itself down in front of parliament. , Dumb question here, but can Russian invaders use the system provided internet as well? \\n\\nOr this there some type of firewall (idk) that will only allow Ukraine people to use? \\n\\nSorry for the ignorant question, I couldn\\'t find the answer in the comments. , Can MR Musk not gift the Ukrainians a large rocket and telemetry to hit a long convoy…. , This is the way…thank you SpaceX and Mr. Musk. , Communications are essential!  Good news! , How do Ukrainians access this? , i wonder if anyone will post about Israeli citizen , That was fast... So were these already on there way??? , Couple years ago I swear I think I read an article on how starlink could threaten Russias state centralized internet. Couldn’t imagine how we’d see it used now as a military comms network , So now Musk is a Putin target? , Legend , Ive talked a lot of shit about Elon over the years but damn this is amazing. Ive just gained so much respect for him. Slava Ukraini , Jesus Christ, this is amazing, so thankful, so happy for them , Amazing!! , Bravo, Elon ! , Maybe ship some direct to Russian citizens too so they can have unfiltered Internet access and see what Putin doesn\\'t want them to see , Hope these won\\'t be tracked by the Russian military , Russia will just bomb the power plants then. , Awesome! I thought Elon Musk only \"enabled\" starlink without sending any receivers. But glad they did! I hope the terminals go to the ukrainian army. , Elon Musk doing anything he can to get people to subscribe to his DSL on steroids internet service.

Good. , thanks elon. what you gave to the ukrainians now is perfectly complimentary to their fight against the russian/belarussian/chechen invasion. as you have said, we won\\'t have a large window of opportunity for mars... quite happening now. , I hope this all works out for Ukraine as promised but it\\'s Elon Musk. It rarely does work out as promised when it comes to Musk. , We\\'ll see. Most people who prepaid over a year ago hardly have service in USA. , How does someone in Ukraine access? , So.... Do we like Elon Musk again? , Now is a very crucial time for some white hats to pen test the terminals they have. , Can we maybe try not to call busy people \"Pedoguys\" if they don\\'t happen to use this internet for something they don\\'t need it for Mr Musk? kthx /s , I guess a war is what it takes to get those damn things. Been waiting for mine for almost a year now. , First good thing that oligarch ever did, and I give him credit for it , I’m not a fan of his, but I am both impressed and grateful for this commitment and effort. , Bro imagine if all Teslas in Russia stopped working and just automatically pulled over. , This man is a machine.

Hopefully it\\'s not used one day to control ai killer robots /s , Elon has been full of empty promises lately.

I LOVE what SpaceX has been able to accomplish, and applaud it regularly. It will still end up bankrupted, according to economics. I would LOVE to have a Tesla, cause they’re fucking awesome, and I’d love to have something that feels so futuristic. I would LOVE to have a Hyperloop, but it’s absolute scientific bullshit that will never exist in reality. We don’t have the 1 million self-driving Tesla “Taxis” he promised would be on the road by the end of 2020 (there is not even 1). The absolutely embarrassing “tunnel” concept put live in Vegas is basically as efficient as a handful of rickshaws. The Tesla semi truck that was supposed to land in 2020 (we have zero). The solar-freaking-roofs that were supposed to revolutionize power generation in the ISA and across the world has been an absolute failure (https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/4/26/22404639/elon-musk-tesla-solar-roof-mistakes-cost-price-increase). The list goes on and on.\\n\\nI will say, for this Starlink delivery, THANK YOU Elon. The Ukrainian people deserve this and I am proud to support you in the delivery of this. However many Reddit-brigadiers come in here to downvote me, the very first downvote will outnumber the number of Tesla driverless Taxis, semi trucks, and hyperloops combined, so go ahead.\\n\\nThank you Elon Musk (this time, but stop selling bullshit to scientifically illiterate people with grandiose nonsense)!\\n\\nLong live Ukraine! 🇺🇦 , [deleted] , I really hope that\\'s not like putting a missile target in your back yard.

Thank you! , I mean, sure, Russia can’t take it down until Russia decides to start shooting Elon’s satellites out of orbit. , Good work Elon🥴👍 , They need this in Kayan state Myanmar , Big daddy Elon delivers! , Just out of morbid curiosity, what is the chance of these routers getting compromised by OPFOR, and then being used to target soldiers/civilians? , Hate that douchebag but for once he actually delivered. Hope this helps Ukraine , Best thing he’s ever done , Holy shit he came thru on his promise. Right on , I thought it was just a rumor that Amazon was in Poland. Guess I was wrong. , Good on him. If there is any semblance of a silver lining to come out of this horrendous war, it\\'s got to be humanity from all walks of life and every political stripe coming together for the greater good. I cannot remember the last time the world felt this united. , Ukraine owns the interwiebes! , r/starlink , They can still take it out. They just have to use their anti satellite tech. , Out of the loop. How does StarLink differ from normal internet? Why would the Russians be able to take communications down? Won\\'t Russia still be able to track the internet usage? , I\\'m all added communication but don\\'t these things heaters in the dish to melt snow? I think they\\'d probably show up on infrared? , Starlink is kinda insane https://satellitemap.space/?constellation=starlink\\n\\nWhat kind of madman builds a satellite constellation with 2000 satellites in it?   It took 70 years for mankind to put that number of satellites into orbit and he singlehandedly caused that number to double in 2 years. , can i send mine? i no longer have service. , how did he get them there? , What kinds of speeds does starlink provide? I thought it was slow. , Does anyone know if Starlink will sniff packets ? , Suck it, pedos , Elon doing something good for once , This tech is a game changer. Not only for this war. , When Pornhub, the taliban, the Vatican, musk, China, and practically every western country all agree you done fucked up , Okay. Score one for Musk.\\n\\n…damnit. , SpaceX haters seem to be focusing on stupid dumb tweets and don\\'t seem to understand space tech and economics. , Sorry but there is 100% potential for Russia taking down the Starlink artsats.  While they are in LEO and are moving quite quickly, they\\'re still an easy target for anti-artsat weapons.  Let\\'s hope they don\\'t take them down and create a lot of debris in LEO which is shared by the ISS, TESS, Hubble Space Telescope, and many other important artsats in LEO. , f\\nft , How do you use it? , Way to go Elon! , So how many Elon-worshipping posts are we supposed to read in the next couple of days? His social media army is in full force. , Perhaps I treated you harshly Elon , I\\'ve posted this earlier but please be aware, there is a potential risk of targeting in on satellite dishes so they should be placed at a safe distance away from the people using them.  Consider using wifi to link to the dish from 100s of meters away, for example. \\n\\nHere\\'s a twitter thread about possible concerns and how Russia might be able to triangulate uplink locations:  https://twitter.com/jsrailton/status/1497745011932286979?s=20&t=DXinHZNGOFbFvV_FJSvmEA\\n\\nSo.... really really really really long ethernet cables or just wifi networking on the ground to  the dish that\\'s located 100s of meters away... , And suddenly, Starlink makes sense, and Elon has gained 1000 points in my book. , Can someone please tell me how to connect to the service? , Is it possible for starlink to supply the population of russia with internet that is unrestricted? , Absolute chad. It warms my heart to see the world helping so much! , The Russians seem to forget one man\\'s threat is a another man\\'s warning. , I can\\'t find concrete evidence, but bear in mind that if this batch is all he\\'s sent, he\\'s already made up for the costs in the free advertising he got from doing it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHell, I bet these came from the marketing dept budget. , Good, now bring the flamethrowers from the boring company , Wow he actually delivered. , Are there going to be base stations in range to relay data to the internet for all of Ukrainian territory?  Most starlink sats don’t have the laser relays.  That is why Starlink couldn’t help in Tonga yet… , How will this help? , He came through! , Great to hear.\\n\\nIf there are criticisms or shortcomings though, hopefully he doesn\\'t resort to accusing people of being pedophiles though. , Surely if Russia captures them then it can take down the internet. So good to see elon helping and that they have high speed Internet now. , Nah, the musk cultists are trying to turn this sub into another musk sub by flooding it with posts on this story.\\n\\nNote: it didn\\'t need to be posted a hundred times , Learn to search, this has been posted already multiple times ffs , Don’t let this distract you from the perverse experiments his company ran on monkeys for Neuralink , Ukrainians for the love of God they are going to turn your cities into rubble if you don\\'t surrender.

He only cares about money. , Gets taken down by clouds and wind instead 😂😂 , Paid in DogeCoins ! , To the moon! , What no submarines this time? , Except, you know, until they take down the starlink terminal... , Bruh, I’m callin it now, either Putin hacks Starlink and embarrasses Elon musk, or he just straight up blows up the satellites , Everyone says this service doesn’t work though. Would love to hear an update about it. , A name to keep in mind: Dzhokhar Dudayev.  Who was killed when a Russian anti-radiation missile that homed in on his satellite phone. Don\\'t assume that satcom terminals can\\'t be located by people who are willing to put in the work. , Certainly a better use of money than taking joyrides in space, I suppose. , That\\'s great, but also feels like a little too much power in one person , Well.... Russia could take it down... Pretty sure any Tesla cars in Russia would stop working the next day, but... They definitely have the ability to take down Elon\\'s satellites.\\n\\n\\nHe\\'s threatening nuclear war, so don\\'t act like it\\'s not realistic that he\\'d do it or threaten it. , I fucking hate Musk, but I must admit, this is an incredible thing he has done. , Marketing tactic. Fuck elon musk , Now all he has to do is not call anyone a pedophile and not be racist , I can’t wait to find out how Elon’s good deed gets turned into a steaming pile of dog shit all the sudden any minute now by something idiotic he’s going to say on twitter. Let’s hope he can stfu on this one for once and actually do some good for a change. , If he paid his taxes he could still do this and not feel it. , Unless Vlad takes out starlink... I\\'m concerned he\\'s getting ready to flip the board... , Ok now pay your taxes. , I’ll believe it when it’s functional , Elon\\'s ego must be higher than a Star-Linked Galaxy , is elon also thinking of crashing some of the starlink satellites into russian satellites like he tried to do with the chinese space station? , *This was the Bond villain’s plan all along. Start a war in order to have his company’s technology installed.* , No humanitarian catastrophe dire enough that Elon Musk wouldn\\'t use it as an advertising opportunity... , It\\'s funny.  A few years ago, everyone on Reddit sucked Musk\\'s dick all day, every day.  But now they\\'re starting to realize that he isn\\'t as smart as he thinks - and he\\'s actually quite an asshole.  So, the dick sucking has gone WAY down.  It\\'s still here (see the top comments), but nowhere near as bad as it used to be. , This man compared my country’s leader, who I don’t agree with on everything, to Hitler a few weeks back. Not sure that can ever be forgiven but it’s undeniable that this is a very good thing. , I\\'ll be very curious to see The speeds that people actually get. From what I\\'ve heard in the US it\\'s not that glamorous. , Lol. They can still jam it all.  🙄 , I know most people in Ukraine are good people but I sure do hope the white nationalist militia doesn\\'t get empowered by all the support they\\'re getting to defend the country.

Having said that I do not wish the man to kill himself and do not respect anyone who says that. He should face JUSTICE, if that is by his people on a noose, or NATO, or on the field, yes but never should a person take their own life. He needs to face justice , Nobody is bringing up the fact about his brain chemistry being affected by his recent medical conditions. , This is a fascinating (and terrifying) read re: Putin… gives some insight into why he thinks he can get away with what he is doing https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/28/world-war-iii-already-there-00012340 , As to why he thinks he can get away with it, see: hostory.\\n\\nHe took parts of georgia, crimea. Nobody batted an eye. he interfered with US elections. twice. Nothing. He has killed or tried to kill numerous people around europe that annoyed him. No consequences.\\n\\nOf course he thought he could do whatever he wants. , It seems Russian forces are using mobile phones and unencrypted civilian radios for communication.

Theres two option, Putin got old and got kinda bored or went crazy, or there is a hidden purpose to this war we dont know yet, my bet is on the last , Just how Us and Allies got away after spreading democracy in middle east , Well, he may have gotten carried away drinking his own kool-aide, but on paper it’s easy to see how he came to think this was probably his most opportune moment.  Between having what everyone knows is the second biggest army in the world, Ukraine having a comedian for a president with an inexperienced cabinet of TV producers, plenty of nukes to aim at Europe so they’ll fuck off, a broken US that’s so dysfunctional it would rather descend into civil war than fix a goddamn bridge, countries still dealing with covid taking out shitloads of people everywhere, Britain trying to dump the only guy who’ll really make it his mission to whip up his stupid hair AND a resistance effort, all that’s left is to push the spineless heads of state into ur corner pocket, and as soon as your front pushes in, Ukraine is just a few cities separated by a lot of empty space right, so as soon as they’re surrounded, any number of tanks showing up will send the President fleeing, and then you can just install your puppet of the week and move on to the next objective.\\n\\nMaybe an idealistic political book from 25 years ago isn’t a substitute for a strategy. , I\\'d say the benefit of global attention and good will far outweighs the cost anyway. , Ya’ll are about get a taste of hi speed internet in rural areas that even most Americans don’t have , Good. I don’t usually like Musk but this is 100% an absolutely good thing he’s doing. , Dang maybe I’ll get to play some legit csgo when this is all over , It\\'s okay reddit will still some how paint him as a bad guy for a tweet , They should charge Rubles. Basically the same thing 😆 , Until he gets pissed and calls Zelensky a pedophile , If God is keeping score of everything we do Elon musk must be exactly even. He does a lot of really great things and a lot of really horrible things. Idk if he\\'s going to go to heaven or hell , Is it geo locked? It would be nice if troops can carry it around. Its only 100w. , He\\'d better not.

He’ll send the bill after the war is over. , Sure but I also wouldn\\'t be surprised if he\\'s selling their info to the Russians. Capitalists gonna capitalise. , because it won\\'t work? , Love it! I\\'m not sure if Russia hates any person more than Elon.

The gang\\'s back! , Certainly makes him seem more compassionate than I thought , Igniting the ev race and revolutionizing space travel was... small? , Swiping right on Ukraine women is back on the table, boys! , Elon craves attention because he’s deeply insecure. Remember when he called that diver trying to help the Thai soccer team a pedo? , what are u giving him , I actually think SpaceX and Tesla aren\\'t going to work out since they\\'re more like vanity dream projects but Starlink will since there is an actual tangible demand for it and a pragmatic goal behind it. , No it isn\\'t. Well to us it is, but to a billionaire this is the left over fluff he found in his pocket. Do you think this actually COST him? Of course not.Something something relative to wealth? Dude could end poverty overnight he\\'s not Jesus he\\'s a snake oil salesman.  All this has done is get people sucking the Elon dick again and probably drove stocks up too, man is a master in manipulation. I am however glad Ukraine now have starlink but shitty people can do good things too just wish people would not jump on his D every time he does anything at all. , Fuckin massive. Good guy Elon comes through. , You serious?  *Everything* Elon does is big.\\n\\nThe dude has literally taken the world lead in space exploration, rocket science, electric cars, solar power and solar batteries.  He gave the world the first secure electronic payment system via Paypal, which gave us Venmo.  He doubled the world\\'s capacity of lithium-ion batteries almost overnight, enabling him to, for the first time, bring the price of an electric vehicle to a point where it\\'s affordable to the masses.  He launched the first new major American car company in nearly 100 years and led it to the top of the heap.  He also did what NASA and the world\\'s most brilliant minds said was impossible by successfully landing solid rocket boosters so they could be re-used, which has revolutionized space travel.  He is now the leading authority on colonizing mars and you will see commercial activity on another fucking planet in your lifetime, thanks to him.  On top of all that, he is *literally* a rocket-scientist. Unlike the other billionaires that want to go to space, such as Bezos or Branson, Musk actually helps design and build the actual rockets and knows everything about how they work.\\n\\nYeah, sometimes he says stupid shit.  No one\\'s perfect.  But, honestly, all the hate the Reddit hive-mind gives Elon Musk is, frankly, fucking preposterous.  He\\'s literally one of the most important humans of the past century.  \\n\\nSo, this latest venture of his, this thing with Starlink in Ukraine (you know, bringing free internet virtually *overnight to an entire country in the middle of a goddamn war*, kind of a big fucking deal that no one else on Earth could or would even attempt to accomplish) should and would surprise ABSOLUTELY NO ONE if they actually did the research and knew what Musk is truly about.  And, I\\'ll tell you this:  it ain\\'t money.  Never has been. , yea, those 50 terminals are sick, thank god elon musk invented earth-satelite-earth communication. bet they paid in bitcoin ;) , I think there’s some saying, a loose cannon is right twice a day?? , Too bad Starlink speeds aren’t. , >All that’s left is for him to call Putin a pedo on Twitter.\\n\\nLmfao the internet never forgets , Don’t forget he will evacuate ISS if Russia tries any funny business. \\n\\nAnd you know what? I believe him. , > His SpaceX rockets gave the West an alternative to Russian rocketry \\n\\nThe alternative was always there, we decided to defund NASA. , > All that’s left is for him to call Putin a pedo on Twitter. Use those slandering powers for good and not evil.\\n\\nIf there were ever a guy he SHOULD make a Hitler meme about... , > All that’s left is for him to call Putin a pedo on Twitter\\n\\nImagine if the way the war ends is because Anonymous leaks a pedo video of Putin from years ago.\\n\\nThen I\\'d know for sure we\\'re living in a simulation. , He could be donating billions and not put a dent in his wealth. I appreciate he\\'s given starlink, but come on he could really be doing more. , >Nice, Elon came through again. He makes big promises but he delivers on quite a lot of them. \\n\\nHe mostly never delivers. He had that stupid thing with the kids in the cave and he decided to call the actual rescuers pedophiles because his idea was dumb. \\n\\nHe sent CPAP machines to hospitals for COVID-19 when he said he\\'d donate ventilators\\n\\nHe promised to manufacture ventilators and never did. Other US car manufacturers did though.\\n\\n\\nHe mostly makes bold claims on Twitter and doesn\\'t follow through to get press. , Unless you somehow disagree with whatever he says and he calls you a pedophile. , i think elon is a massive douchebag but nothing makes me happier than the moments when I can genuinely cheer for him\\n\\nthis is one of those moments , He could be even more consistently anti-Putin by eliminating all the tolerated racism in his company , He’ll profit long term if Ukraine holds out, it’s a smart PR play with a solid foothold in to the Ukrainian market.  Win win. , One could say he has undermined Russia more than any other civilian , lmfao , you are a good organic marketing bot. i bet it wasnt even hard to tear down your human common sense in order to spread your feelings and dreams wrapped as facts in social media. do you even know how to formulate questions in your head anymore? \\nbtw: can you recommend me some crypto? , NASA was never reliant on Russian rockets. \\n\\nReliance on fossil fuels is a conscious choice by the Us govt. tesla hasn’t done anything about that. US is also the number 2 oil producer in the world. We’re never reliant on it. , He\\'s the Edison of our time. , >Nice, Elon came through again. He makes big promises but he delivers on quite a lot of them. \\n\\nDo you mean he rarely delivers? Serious question , Elon has never designed anything. The engineers he pays do. , >Say what you like about Elon but he’s been doing his part to undermine Russia\\n\\nthe only war is class war , I think he\\'s an egotistical blowhard, but he came through and deserves all the props for this. , I mean this is a net positive obviously but is anyone else concerned that individuals are now able to provide aid and influence on the same level as entire countries now? Billionares are literally running their own company-states now. , > His SpaceX rockets gave the West an alternative to Russian rocketry\\n\\nWhat? Are you claiming America didn\\'t have rockets before elon? , Sorry but in terms of stuff like this, what has he actually come through on? As far as public outreach for crisis situations, all I\\'m aware of is his failed donation of 1,000 ventilators that weren\\'t ventilators. And his mini submarine that was rejected for the cave rescue. , >He makes big promises but he delivers on quite a lot of them. \\n\\n3 is a lot? , > Nice, Elon came through again. He makes big promises but he delivers on quite a lot of them. \\n\\nlmao what? he seems to miss most of them, even his cars are garbage , You think reddit has a rosy outlook of Elon? Wha? , I mean, I\\'m still convinced he has a secret volcano lair in the mid-Pacific, but I agree. He did a good, this time. , I don\\'t think elon cares too much what a demographic of 12 year olds cares about him , Everyone on reddit basically hates Elon wtf are you talking about lmao , Oh so you are with the other 98% minority that thinks this? , Wait until you find out he\\'s working for the Russians. , What exactly deserves praise from this? it is a picture of things in a truck. Does any of it actually work? As a cause for concern, see his submarine to rescue kids and his donation of machines for covid that were not what he promised. , Tomorrow we\\'ll find out he\\'s feeding information to the Russian , Thats the thing about most people, they can be bad and still do good things, and good people can do bad things. I wont say which one he is because I can’t make the discretion for that, as for putin? Evil, garbage, awful human being who has only ever done bad things , What happened with Germany? I suspected they would have been one of Ukraine\\'s biggest supporters, but they\\'ve seemingly supported so little. , private entity vs bureaucratic government .. they don\\'t want to be fast or efficent, they want as many people on the payroll as possible doing as little work as possible and if you do it for long enough eventually people will stop asking why everything they do costs millions of tax money. , I like Elon. I like this very much. , The world* , The Russian establishment apparently wasn\\'t very happy about the Ukraine invasion to begin with. Now add in that it\\'s going badly and the world is more unified against Russia than expected, I don\\'t think they\\'d follow orders even if Vlad demanded nukes be used. He will probably be deposed from within if he goes that far. , Not gonna happen , [removed] , He\\'s done a lot of nice things, and some flubs, and he has a lot of naysayers. They shit all over him yesterday when he tweeted that the dishes were on their way. , Only real questionable action was forcing workers back to work in Cali against covid mandate , He can get a bit cocky at times, but he\\'s a good guy at heart. As good as you can be when you have that amount of wealth. , Elon is a good billionaire. Now he might have autism but it doesn\\'t really change him as a person , Dude, Elon Musk is a wealth-hoarding megalomaniac who wants to get as much attention as possible from everything. Don\\'t kid yourself to think that he\\'s doing this for any other reason than for people to post that \"ELON MUSK HAS SAVED UKRAINE WITH STARLINK\". It\\'s great that starlink is open, but that is the fucking bare minimum so stop giving so much unnecessary praise.\\n\\nDo you think it\\'s a coincidence that I have read several threads regarding Elon fucking Musk when russia is invading ukraine? Stfu about that mental patient and focus on the country being invaded. , He\\'s a person doing great things in greater scale, but he has a terrible character. , Nah, hes a rich asshole. That just doesn\\'t like, prevent him from doing the right thing sometimes. And he gets credit for it when he does.\\n\\nI still dont like him? But big respect for this , He’s a multiBILLIONAIRE. He didn’t become one by being nice , Elon musk has bad sides to his character as do most people. , He\\'s a great person.  Stop focusing on trivia. , Nnnnooo, he\\'s a bag of shit. But if his ego makes him do decent things every so often, that\\'s fine. , He\\'s absolutely a bad person. , Eccentric more like self centric , i think hes just autistic and I dont mean that as a negative thing. The internet loves to hate. Dude just wants to change the world. \\n\\nnote: I am not an elon fanboy but I do admire most of his ventures. , War has changed? , Neither do Russian civilians , Yeah, I really do not like the guy.

I can\\'t believe I had to write that. , Me too, Musk is a strange man, but kept his promise. , The greatest tragedy: A person you hate with a passion just did something good. /s , How did he con you , And why exactly is he conman? , Good deeds never go unpunished however… , \"weaponized autism\" , He isn’t a conman, the guy has a proven track record of delivering on the vast majority of what he says he’s going to do. People just seem to dislike him because he tweets weird shit and he often underestimates how long something is going to take. But he is definitely not a conman. , Perhaps, this makes you hate him a little less now? , Excellent deed. \\n\\nAlso, a conman still looks like an angel next to Vladimir Putin. , He is a good Bond Villian basically. , He\\'s anything but a conman , It’s like your own Wi-Fi hotspot but the hotspot is a space constellation of satellites , Only if they have authorised terminals... , Even people whe don\\'t like have the ability to do good, we don\\'t need to admire musk now but we do need to thank him for his actions on this one , Spitroast always an option , Backdoor! , He does and he doesn\\'t.

Probably not the wisest option in a situation like this. , It takes more than one box truck to bring water, rofl. , and helping ukraine ? , It\\'s entirely possible SpaceX asked the State department if they could send them and the State Department took over logistics and paid premium for every user terminal SpaceX was giving them (SpaceX ist struggling to make as many dishes as they would like to and make them at a cost that users want to pay, they have sold the first batches under production cost).\\n\\nWe don\\'t know what\\'s going on behind the scenes.\\nneedless to say, Musk could stand to gain a lot of good relations with the country of Ukraine, which might once again be a force in Rocketry. , No. My favorite Musk promise was when he told the South Australian government he could build a massive battery storage plant (the largest battery in the world) in 100 days to resolve their blackout problems or he would build it for free. He built it within 100 days. It stores excess power generated from a variety of sources. It can power 30,000 homes.\\n\\nMusk has done some stupid shit that garnered him bad publicity, but he has done a lot of awesome stuff too.\\n\\nThe media likes to compare him to Tony Stark. Remember, Tony Stark was an asshole for most of his fictional life. , Tryzub , No you need open sky foe the phased array antenna. But you can just click a long ethernet cable to the system all the way to your metro/garage/bunker and then you have wifi there. , This is true for every single human to ever exist , Nice. , I’d gladly give my starlink dish to someone in Ukraine. They need it far more. , What the fuck are you even trying to say? He should’ve just given Ukraine starlink before this? Just for fun? , if you order a Russian mail order bride, you can tweet Musk and state that your financials have been seized by Russia..\\n\\njust thinkin\\' out loud , Russia would have mistook it for an ICBM and we\\'d all be dead. Praise God Elon for not trying to land his giant dick rocket in the middle of a warzone. , The Ukrainians did request it of him, it\\'s not like Elon just up and did it as a publicity stunt. , It’s easy. \\n\\nHe’s not woke. You only see that side of politics hating him and they are disproportionately represented online and in media.\\n\\nProbably most real people think positively or neutral on him , Remember he had an affair with amber heard when she’s still married to Johnny depp and he gives weird name to his son , Because he lies to sell products?  Hyperloop? Trains floating on cussions of air... In a vacuum? Lol.  Brand new trucks? Pre order today and get it in 2 years! *3 years pass and no trucks*.\\n\\nGuy oversell and over promises. His company is ridiculously overvalued because of this. So what does he do? Twitter poll as to whether he should sell some of his shares in an attempt to avoid certain legal hurdles that may arise when the value of his company comes crashing down.  Now he is the richest man in the world. \\n\\nJust google his promises and what has been delivered to see what kind of guy he is.  I doubt star link to ukraine is anything more than a or stunt for him based on his track record. , [deleted] , you probably need therapy , Anything can be jammed. Starlink uses beam forming so it’s fairly resistant. , Your mom can still be jammed , I\\'m happy to hear that. Dude is a social mess, but I believe he has heart , he forgave you too.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\njk youre a nobody who doesnt need forgiving , Not these, not easily , Yeah, but missiles cost a lot more than these terminals. Combined with a point to point wireless bridge with parabolic antennas, you could set a terminal up a mile away from anywhere populated. If we consider how much an air strike costs and compare that to the cost of the terminal, the wireless bridge, and some patch cables, Ukraine can win this war by just waiting for Russia to run out of missiles. , Why wouldn\\'t it work? , Source for pedo claim? , They\\'re concerned about Russia knocking out internet infrastructure in the area. Unless they start flinging anti sat missiles around they aren\\'t knocking out starlink. , There\\'s always a way, but extra redundancy never hurts in a time where a critical junction of national internet infrastructure can get hit by a stray russian missile.\\n\\nAlso, starlink is wireless and can work even if all you have is an old oil generator on an open field. , Starlink is likely very vulnerable.  All Russia needs to do is blast RF broadband ( or at least across the uplink band) towards the satellites and they\\'ll be functionally deaf. , Starlink is 100% not susceptible to the same things other networks are , Not in near the same way as their existing infrastructure.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure you understand internet infrastructure. , High speed satellite internet. Russians can\\'t cut communications. , Imagine for a second this was remotely true. One scientist somewhere deorbits whatever random satcube or leo sat while Putin is giving some speech and it’s just obliterates the stage out of no where. No one expects the Spanish Inquisition. lol I’d watch this movie. , You know.. I wonder if he could drop some boosters onto those Russians, they are steerable after all..\\n\\nNot sure he wants to watch out for polonium underwear for the rest of his life. , Well I\\'m not supposed to tell you this, but the US defense budget\\'s been going towards teleportation, so it\\'s pretty convenient. , Wouldn’t benefit Russia as much as you think. The issue right now is that the Russian military already has internet and they’re taking out Ukraine’s internet. They’ve gambled a lot on the fact that they would be able to keep the world in the dark while they carried out their plan. With satellite internet access, they won’t be able to keep themselves hidden from the world and Ukrainians will find it easier to coordinate counterattacks. , You mean the starlink terminals? Nope. If Elon’s got hardware addresses recorded on the equipment they send, it would be easy enough to put them on a blacklist or firmware lock them entirely. , SpaceX has been on a W streak for about the last 15 years if you can set aside the fact that Elon happens to be the majority shareholder. , 1) not nearly enough  \\n2) that would be an attack on the US , Spaced randomly, and connected to other equipment and repeating the signal in you could hide your location somewhat. It’s a quantity thing that would take time to resolve if enough were deployed. One at every intersection in a city would mean that troops would have to fight every intersection to accomplish takedown without having new ones pop up as replacements. It’s the nordvpn strategy lol. , No, they need regulatory approval to operate in any country. , Russia most likely already has the necessary equipment for internet access it’s just that they’ve been jamming or destroying Ukraine’s internet infrastructure. The reason this news is huge is that Russia will have a much harder time jamming starlink without also targeting resources that would spark war with other countries. Can they use starlink? Yes. Will it give them some kind of edge or negate the edge Ukrainians are getting. I think not. , No he doesn\\'t. , It looks like you shared an AMP link.

There are 2,000+ Starlink satellites and they can be maneuvered while Russia\\'s tech is normally used for disabled satellites. , Starlink has 2,000 satellites in orbit, with another 28,000 planned. Starlink launches 60 satellites on one rocket, and the rocket promptly returns to its launch pad, upright, afterward.\\n\\nA user needs a small satellite dish that has the footprint of a pizza box. The dish needs any view of the sky because Starlink satellites form a moving mesh or grid or constellation moving through the sky. The download speed varies from 150 to 500 Mbps.\\n\\nI imagine the satellite signals are encrypted. Good luck with Russia trying to track all those signals. So far Russia has proven itself incompetent at waging war. Russia\\'s new approach is brute force, which may win, but Russia is far from doing anything nuanced like tracking down individual satellite dishes. , This is wireless, communicates with satellites. Conventional internet works over telephone, coax, fibre, etc, all of which can be tampered with. , You are giving Russia far too much credit. They are throwing the kitchen sink at Ukraine now, but only because they got their ass handed to them by Ukraine. Russia\\'s approach now is just brute force, not nuanced targeted attacks. , Other people do work there. , He is a guy who got tired of waiting for the future to happen. \\n\\nHe is more driven by pioneering space travel.

It is one that will make a Mars colony achievable, solving the problem of it being too difficult to get resources to Mars. , Tesla Plaid , Starlink is SpaceX, and SpaceX has great reusable rockets to deploy 60 satellites in one go and then return the rockets to Earth, landing upright on their launch pads. , 100mbps , Between 150 and 500 Mbps. Speeds improve with each batch of 60 satellites launched. , Depends if the signals can be tracked or not. , You sound like you know what you’re talking about so I’m going to take your word for it. , Has life got you down? Here is a hug. +hug+ , You need to connect to a router via wifi that is connected to a Starlink satellite dish. I am guessing, but I would guess the service is only being used by the military and government officials. , No. Starlink has stated it won\\'t operate where governments don\\'t want it. , In simples terms, Communication and Infrastructure. , The 64-year-old pedo guy attacked him first.  And I think it\\'s important to note that Elon Musk won the lawsuit brought by the pedo guy. Just sayin\\'! , No not at all. These are just ground terminals that connect to starlink satellites. , Each terminal that goes online within Ukraine will be its own point of failure.\\n\\nSatellites need to talk to a ground station which then talk to datacenters, but Poland has a ground station which is close enough.\\n\\nWired and wireless broadband all have multiple points of failures from within Ukraine.

People get between 150 and 500 Mbps down and service improves as they launch new satellites (60 per launch). The Starlink satellites are in low Earth orbit, unlike traditional slow, limited satellite services. It is why Starlink wants to have something like 30,000 satellites. They have 2,000 up there now. , An Elon Rocket boosted logistics service to overthrow Bezos Amazon seems like a good idea. , SpaceEx , SpaceX , I could see this being real . , I guess I just don\\'t see how grimes is relevant here , SpaceEx shipping , Grimes? , Dejon\\'t , Or the one month free trial under a different email address. , Boy. did Bezos get the short end of the deal on that prime membership , And they actually all arrived! , I guarantee it was a charter flight , LOL , Maybe. But priority business shipping is their bread and butter. Their whole thing is that entities are willing to pay a premium for speed. , EU have supplied the Ukrainian pilots with fighter jets: Putin is essentially fighting the whole ass world right now, if only Ukrainian ethnicity. , He isn\\'t getting away with it. With all the sanctions pit on Russia, no matter if they win over Ukraine or if they lose, their economy will soon be very screwed. Russia has a huge economic problem. , Not even sure how this entire shit will end up. In any case it doesn\\'t seem good for Putin. He has some unrealistic conditions to stop the invasion. , He believed his own propaganda. That the West is too greedy and decadent to stand up to Russia over Ukraine. That we wouldn\\'t dare give up their oil and gas and bank accounts, nor send Ukraine billions of dollars of aid and weapons. , You can not respect me. He should kill himself 😄 it would be the bravest thing he can do. , I disagree. I have always believed people should be offered the option of physitn assisted suicide (death with dignity) and never blamed anybody wirh serious and life long mental illness of taking their own life. In some cases, it is the only humane thing for them.\\n\\n\\nEdit: anyone who disagrees can eat a dick and clearly hasn\\'t worked with terminally ill people and seen their suffering and heald their hands through the end stages of their life. It can be HORIFFIC and extremely painful. , The world would absolutely, obviously, objectively be a better place if Putin killed himself. You\\'re not virtuous for pretending like his life has value. , I agree he needs to face justice. But there is no justice in Russia. He\\'s too well connected, too many shady deals to forcefully provide cover. If he manages to cross a line where he loses that cover, then his shadow will have a bullet in his back faster than he can run. Taking his own life is the most courageous thing he could do after everything he\\'s already done. , Here I am thinking the Russians should drag him out on the streets and hang him like Mussolini… but maybe I’m not respectable when it comes to dealing with the deaths of dictators. , It\\'s not the entire world at all. India and China both have strong ties with Russia and between them that\\'s like 3 Billion people. Their governments aren\\'t coming out in direct support of Putin, but they aren\\'t condemning him either and it\\'s a certainty that they will find a way to continue cooperating with Russia in ways that skirt the US and EU sanctions. On top of that, there are plenty of ppl in both of those countries that hate the west and support russia, especially in China. , If Putin cared about Ukrainian people, Russian people, or the world- he would stop this. It is clearly time for him to step down or cope with the reality of being shoved down. Putin could halt his war, purge his own government\\'s corrupt facism, and transition power to his people, but there is no indication he is capable of that. He has only acted to consolidate more power for himself. He is a paranoid dictator who has taken many lives and earned many enemies. Putin will likely not surrender until he is incapacitated by physical illness or arrested by his own countrymen. I will not mourn his inevitable (and hopefully impending) death, but perhaps a little for the malformed Russian child who was long ago lost in the monster. People deserve the chance to find leaders like Zelenskyy. Glory to Ukraine. , He should rot in jail alone, with no one and nothing! , Fighting 2020 wars with a 1950\\'s mindset. , Ehh, if he kills himself it just extradites the process.\\n\\nI\\'ve never lost a second of sleep over Hitler killing himself. , Because he\\'s done it so many times, from Crimea, Donbass to Georgia and many many more... He thought he could replicate it but his miscalculation in on how he didn\\'t realize that the world is still coping in a post-pandemic setting and everyone is alert and paranoid on the next big thing... And bad news for Putin, he\\'s that next big thing that the world believes it should stop , Dude has nuclear weapons threatened nuclear war again today, and continues to kill innocent people as we speak. If it saves the life of a single innocent Ukrainian I think I’d be alright with him killing himself. , Doesn\\'t someone in his entourage have a clue. Surely there\\'s a plan if your leader goes doolaly? , Beauty. They are making a horrible mess of it but unfortunately of Ukraine too. I\\'m hoping the Rus military is like this all the way through the branches. , It\\'s like me phoning a guy down the street and saying \\'I\\'m coming round tonight to punch you in the face\\' in my neighbourhood you would get welcomed with a brick. Again no sense. Putin keeps threatening and we can give the Intelligence service a rest.  Like the Nuke thing. You wouldn\\'t threaten it would you? Your only chance would be a totally unexpected launch. Now there\\'s fk knows what flying over Russia and every missile in Europe just went on standby. Madness. , Its possible to jam the uplink, but you would have to look at the STK simulation to say for certain and to what degree. , It must be a bigger plan than Ukraine. He is going to keep upping the violence until he hopes everyone will give in. I don\\'t think Putin will care about any lives including his own it\\'s victory or nothing. His own people have got to move on him it\\'s the only way unless they can put a team or a drone onto him. Something needs to happen he is using thermobaric bombs on Civilians. , The global goodwill is making me happy, too. , so what..not huge elon fan but this is a genuine good deed and should be celebrated. , I think Starlink can be profitable just on US revenue, so the rest of the world is a bonus to the business case rather than a requirement. , Lol anything to deny this man even one modicum of praise , May I ask what you’ve done to help the people of Ukraine? , And you sitting on your couch commenting on reddit isn’t helping nobody , The only time exposure was worth it Elon musk has always been my favorite mad scientist , I wouldn’t be surprised if the US Government contacted him and asked/paid him to do this. Getting Ukraine accurate intel quickly is critical. , So in terms of actual service how much traffic can each terminal handle? Like they give one terminal to different important government bureaus and to the city hall of each large city? Can each terminal give wifi to a small neighborhood? Or just one office building? , He doesn’t need the attention. Neither tesla nor spacex have a marketing budget. , And the data collection , Yup. Win-win for Musk. SpaceLink securing government contracts would be straight cash. , Also, there\\'s probably a lot of telemetry data that can be gathered, one of the best way to stress test a system where a lot of client exist in one particular area, somewhat of a lifetime chance to beta test your services , Good. He should see a reward for doing this. , Oh yea. Every eyeball in the world is on Ukraine right now. Couldn\\'t have asked for a better ad. , at a time when they need it most , Can confirm, moved from AT&T with an advertised 6 MB/S, which rarely actually went above 1, and it\\'s SO MUCH FASTER. , Oddly enough, Eastern European countries might have better internet and phone services than Western+NA, as their infrastructure has been practically fully replaced in 90s. I\\'ve got much better signal in national parks in the middle of the nature in the East than in similar areas  in the West. , Eh, Starlink service has issues. , He…umm…didn’t use recycled cardboard!! What an asshole!!! , Comments like this makes rich people don\\'t wanna do good stuff. \\n\\nBecause even if you do minor stuff people can twist it to being a bad thing.\\n\\nHim giving a truck full of equipment to communicating with satellites would be a net positive even if he charged for subscription.\\n\\nHe did not do that. He gave them more. But if he didn\\'t it would be a net positive. , You\\'re right, it would make him akin to a war criminal , Stupid comment , Ah yes I hadn’t thought of the fact that there is no electricity in all of Ukraine.  Probably no trucks with AC converters or gas generators or solar panels either. , turns out there are other ways to deliver electricity other than satellites , I rarely have an argue to facepalm, but this takes the cake , Generators , Seriously, this. Redditors just love a happy ending. , I\\'m out of the loop , The Russians actually spit on his shoes , *handedly , If Elon is an idiot I can\\'t even imagine what you are , It should be about as good as you can get.\\n\\nIt\\'s a phased array antenna, which can beamform nearly anywhere in the sky. On top of this, it isn\\'t transmitting to a fixed point in the sky (Geo-stationary), but to moving satellites in LEO. On top of this, there would usually be a dozen or so at any given time.\\n\\nFor this to be really effective, Russia would need to have a jamming drone in between the Dish, and each overhead satellite. There\\'s several hundred dishes here... which just sort of paints a picture of how hard it would be...\\n\\nIt\\'s possible that a wide band jammer could effect it if it was very, very close, but at that point, they could just kick over the dish. It\\'s also questionable whether this would be effective or not. , I think it\\'s dual use, with US/NATO in mind, so it should be ok. , If you get close enough you can put some jam on one. But more than likely it will just make the Russians jelly. , Eh no big deal. I don\\'t think the soldiers are gonna be eating breakfast around them. , We\\'ve been jammed! , Good question. How many jars of strawberry jam could you throw at a Starlink dish before it stops working? , You don\\'t have to jam shit if you\\'ve got enough satellite killer satellites, and ground ascent satellite killers...\\n\\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-condemns-dangerous-russian-anti-satellite-test/story?id=81181090\\n\\nAdmittedly with Starlink that\\'s A LOT of satellites, although if you destroy enough, the debris fields would probably take care of the rest :/ , I don’t think China would think twice about shooting down the satellites if they tried to sneak internet in over there. , As far as I know they could easily be jammed. But to jam a device you\\'ll have to be relatively close. Not something that can be done on a large scale. \\n\\nNormally you would jam a cell tower to impact a large area. With this you would need to jam many devices or the satalite itself. , Why? Do you have a habit of pouring jam into things??\\n\\nI\\'m genuinely curious... , They might act as beacons for targeted strikes. Going to want to be careful , >I\\'m curious how jam resistant it is.\\n\\nit\\'s not\\n\\n>Also how detectable they are for SIGINT\\n\\nRelatively easy from the air, not as easy from the ground but not hard.  I would not try to use them too close to assets you are concerned about. (At least the first gen units). , *sighs* fine I\\'ll go to Ukraine with a selection of jams and marmalades, and smother these bad boys.\\n\\nFor science. , China would react by seizing Tesla\\'s assets, including their giant factory. , >jam resistant\\n\\n*Lonestar has entered the chat* , why are you wiping jam on satellites , And how do you power them? ( off grid how much solar power would you need) , Apparently it has to be line of sight no obstructions to jam one sooooo, nope. Not without giving away your own position jamming it. Then whatever silence they needed better be quick or your fucked , No, it\\'s a business move for sure. This is some high profile marketing of a product I\\'d barely heard of before. Cool that it\\'s helping this situation though. , but emerald mines and bad tweets ^/s , While spaceX is his most successful idea, and the landable rockets are a dope innovation, he didn\\'t quite revolutionise space travel, as can be seen from his leaked email about having to severely ramp up launches for spacex to be sustainable and the company\\'s figures showing that the time it takes them to refurbish a rocket is longer than the refurbishment time goal they themselves have set earlier (and which is the limit for them to not lose money on doing multiple launches)\\n\\nTesla wasn\\'t really his doing, he was only a high level investor that took over the company and claims to be its founder.\\n\\nHe has also peddled batshit ideas about rocket based mass transport, claimed early 20th century vacuum trains are his idea and then showed us why those didn\\'t catch on earlier, and built a tunnel for taxi traffic jams.\\n\\nElon\\'s ideas have been shown to be almost always unsustainable, and frequently borderline insane. His only successful ventures are those he invested in (hey, he\\'s a great investor, I have to give him that), and add to this the horrible working conditions and other slimy shit he has done. , Oh for sure, he fucking sucks. But this is nice. , That guy wasn\\'t a diver. He didn\\'t take part in the actual rescue.\\n\\nHe was called a pedo because he attacked Musk on TV. Read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommonSenseSkeptic/comments/pm4egc/elon_musk_called_a_rescue_diver_in_thailand_pedo/). , Credit where credit is due. , They didn\\'t invent E-S-E communication, but they made it *exceedingly* better.\\n\\nStarlink uses an active-phased-array antenna, that\\'s as complex as you\\'ll find in advanced military aircraft. This makes it extraordinarily hard to jam. \\n\\nAlso, most communication satellites are in Geostationary Orbit, which has a lower throughput, and much higher latency. \\n\\nIn order to get the latency down, you have to go into Low Earth Orbit. In low Earth Orbit, you have to have a LOT more satellites to makes this work. \\n\\nSo, SpaceX, in a few years, invented one of the most advanced satellites ever made, found a way to make them low cost (about 1/50th the cost of the competition), and would deploy *60* of them at a time.\\n\\nAlso, to deploy these, they used the most advanced rocket ever made, which can land itself on a self piloting drone ship...\\n\\nThe steps to make what is happening here is simply staggering. It\\'s one of the most rapid tech innovations we\\'ve seen in human history. I\\'m so goddamned proud of the SpaceX team, and this genuinely makes me happy to be part of the human race. , > bet they *paid* in bitcoin\\n\\nFTFY.\\n\\nAlthough *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn\\'t help you), it is only correct in:\\n\\n * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*\\n\\n * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*\\n\\nUnfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.\\n\\n*Beep, boop, I\\'m a bot* , >earth-satelite-earth\\n\\nPretty sure he didn\\'t invent that personally. , >  thank god elon musk invented\\n\\nNot only did Musk not invent it E-S-E communication, he isn\\'t even the primary engineer who worked on Starlink.\\n\\nHe paid for Starlink, but he didn\\'t do all the primary work on it. And Starlink didn\\'t invent E-S-E. , Elon musk has never invented anything in his life. The engineers he overworked designed this. Don\\'t inflate his ego any more. , … with /r/Monero so they cannot be traced by Russia , I mean, satellite phones have been around for a long time. Elon didn’t invent anything. However, he did make it significantly more accessible to us little broke folk. , Knowing Musk, they probably paid him in Dogecoin. , your username not being valid hexadecimal despite starting with 0x triggers me , In their defense it\\'s hard to detect sarcasm through text so you should\\'ve put an /s for clarity , How many people can use the network with this amount of terminals? , Why tf is sarcasm needed here anyway? , I hate Elon and am extremely critical of Tesla but StarLink is objectively a massive improvement over existing satellite internet. It is an actual market disruptor in that space.\\n\\nMusk didn’t do shit to invent it, but that doesn’t make the tech bad or this act useless. , Lmao shut the fuck up you small little baby ;) , That truck box is probably deeper than 1-2 rows of boxes. There could be multiple trucks. Even if there aren’t, getting internet access to 50 strategic locations is a net plus. I don’t see why you feel the need to bash this? , Starlink is a huge step forward, the difference between traditional satellite ISP (Hughes) and Starlink is like dialup to cable. \\n\\nHe might not have invented shit but he put one on my roof for $99/month and it’s a godsend. \\n\\n182-12-43 internet speeds in very rural America. Up from 1-.1-1000. , I think you\\'re thinking of a broken clock is right twice a day? , Ok buddy, go ahead and donate your super fast satellite internet to Ukraine then 🙄 , If it’s significantly faster than handwritten letters I think they’ll be ecstatic , what\\'s this a reference to? , *Funding secured*\\n\\nfor Ukrainian internet access , Inb4 he tweets rubble going down, followed by SEC announcing an investigation. , Evacuate ISS? Can you explain please? , I mean... it is in his vested interest to do these things. He just made Starlink a priority service for the State Department to deploy to any country or group resisting our enemies, and SpaceX just became THE launch provider to the ISS. , Yeah, in his best interest to facilitate it since they got the contract with Nasa now. , Elon Musk is an egomaniac, everything he does is to glorify himself. Its why he threw a hissy fit when those kids were rescued from the cave by not him.  \\n\\n\\nFortunately, this is one of those times where he actually can be the hero and rightfully get the glory. He is uniquely placed to actually address the communications and space flight issues. , It’s also not impossible for the Dragon to boost the ISS. It would be a big task and the dragon would not be even close to ideal. But it’s apparently physically possible for it to work. , Guarantee he will , Can we please stop saying “he will” like he is some kind of god? \\n\\nHis company will, that’s it. It’s like saying “Boeing will” or “Lockheed will” , This will never happen so elon is just using it to pump up his image. Why would you give him any credit for this? Do you think Russia or America would abandon anyone at the ISS and we need daddy elon to help? lmao, no. , compare prices and youd be amazed, spacex is fucking cheap , We did not defund NASA. We ended the space shuttle program which was over 30 years old. SpaceX and Boeing got contracts to make new vehicles. Note that Rockwell made the shuttle, and Boeing bought that part of Rickeell in the 1990s. NASA has never built its own crew vehicles, it has always been companies under contract. \\n\\nThe structure of the contract is different, but it’s not much different from how things always have been. Boeing got greedy, inefficient, and slow, so SpaceX was able to disrupt this industry. NASA is extremely happy with this. , [SLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System) is the alternative without SpaceX and it\\'s a mess. , You mean the flying death trap called the Space Shuttle that cost over ten times as much as Space X\\'s Dragon? , not just defunding nasa. Nasa basically had to cancel the space shuttle because it was way too expensive (eating up a huge part of nasa budget) and not safe enough. \\n\\nBasically the combination of hanging a very fragile heat shield to the SIDE of the rocket instead of on top in combination with the main fuel tank being hydrogen which means it needs to be well insulated by foam, which sometimes breaks off and falls away, was a deadly combination that pretty much couldnt be fixed without making a new rocket. (the foam would punch holes in the heatshield which happened twice, and 1 of those times the entire space shuttle disintegrated upon reentry)\\n\\nAlso 1 space shuttle launch exploded because of issues with the o ring design in between the solid booster segments, but that problem was very fixable, and was fixed.\\n\\nSadly for nasa the space shuttle was the only way up for their astronauts so after cancelling that they were left without a ride of their own until spacex crew dragon came along. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nCould you imagine if spaceX didnt exist and if the USA was still reliant on russians for shooting their astronauts up right now?? Because boeing still cant get it up. Damn im glad spacex crew dragon is a thing! , Until the crew dragon, we hadn\\'t sent humans to space from US soil since the shuttle program was shut down.\\n\\nThe shuttle was a death trap. We had no alternative. , Not a coincidence btw , The Russians would be told it is fake. The war would go on. Lying is a bitch. We’re gonna have to kill a lot of Russians before they remove their leader and stop believing in lies , You mean like this? https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-musk-donated-5044000-shares-charity-sec-filing-2022-02-15/ , He donated almost 6 billion this year... , No one wants to talk about predistribution. , What happened to the rail system he made Cali cancel their existing plans for?  And then failed to deliver? , Aww, did someone short-sell Tesla stock or has someone\\'s been eating sour grapes?\\n\\nElon Musk sent Tesla engineers and a small submarine to northern Thailand to help with the rescue effort, but Mr Unsworth, the 64-year-old cave explorer, had nothing better to do than to insult the entire Tesla team by calling their effort nothing but a PR stunt.  Your buddy, Mr. Unsworth was in every regard a basic asshole--sort of like you in here squawking like a stuck parrot.\\n\\nElon Musk said he\\'d donate ventilators, and he did so.  They were BIPAPS which, with slight modification, could very well be used for endotracheal ventilation.  What\\'s up your ass?  There are a number of posts confirming this from facilities such as Hackensack Meridian NJ, NYC Health System Bronx, as well as MLK Community Healthcare in South LA.  They received ventilators and they were grateful.  Why aren\\'t you, you whiner?\\n\\nHe donated StarLink Internet to a few German towns during flooding.  \\n\\nHe\\'s donated cash and supplies to so many crises around the world.  The list goes on and one.  \\n\\nYes, he makes bold claims and he always gives his (and his team\\'s) best effort.  So sit the fuck down and shut up. , Joining the downvote brigade, but I fail to see Elon as anything else than an American Oligarch. Egotistical, cult of personality, takes billions from our government to privatize previously public enterprises like NASA or (hopefully not) public transport. \\n\\nIf the US collapsed instead of the USSR you better believe it would be him or someone like him buying up all of the formerly state owned enterprises and immiserating everyone else for his personal gain. Turning off replies in the inbox for this one haha. , The guy has issues. Everybody has issues. A bit dishonest to present those as if that was all there is to Musk and ignore everything else. Sure, he did not deliver on every single promise. And yet he managed to bring innovation to at least two completely stagnant industries. I\\'ve seen concept EV\\'s for ages and yet they never materialised into a product. I\\'ve seen VTOL rocket prototypes for just as long and yet again it was Musk that actually made them viable. And now actually useful, low latency satellite internet that doesn\\'t suck.\\n\\nBtw, there\\'s more to the diver story but I\\'d say that anybody that tells someone else to \"stick it where it hurts\" should expect an unfriendly response (doesn\\'t mean it wasn\\'t dumb, just human). , He also does a lot also. Such is the life of a celebrity/genius level individual in the 21st century, , This starlink thing is literally the only good thing he\\'s personally done. It\\'s a fantastic thing, but the guy is still trash. , He mostly never delivers? He literally has the biggest rocket ever built on the fucking launch pad currently while having the biggest car company in the world.\\n\\nHe makes absolutely massive promises and people call him a freud when he \"only\" reach like 70% of it and still are lightyears ahead of everybody else. , The government and people in charge of the rescue operation asked him to continue work on the sub. It was a random volunteer cave diver who had no say in any of the decision making that told him to shove it up his ass. , When he takes on impossible tasks like fixing US public transit or developing a reusable space transport systems, he only has a 10% success rate. When he attempts more achieavable tasks like interacting with a human being on twitter or naming a child, his success rate skyrockets to 15%. , > He mostly never delivers. He had that stupid thing with the kids in the cave and he decided to call the actual rescuers pedophiles because his idea was dumb.\\n\\nOk to clear up the timeline, his team worked on a mini submersible so they could possibly manoeuvre kids out of the tunnels, they were working with the Thai government on if it would help. A British expat diver who was advising the rescuers told him to \"shove his submarine up his ass\". Elon retaliated against that expat labelling him a \"Pedo\". , That one is an iffy issue - the stated racism was two black warehouse workers who would call eachother the N word, another black person working there didn\\'t like that so he sued the company. Always a lot more to a story if you actually look into it. , Where is he wrong? , Oops you don’t know your history , Did you know edison did not invent the light bulb?  Most of edisons \"inventions\" were stolen from other inventors such as Nikola Tesla.  edison only patented other peoples ideas, and by doing so he was credited with the invention.  If you\\'re skeptical, it can be verified with a google search. , No , Sure he is, so are a lot of high achieving men. Better than being a useless cunt in my book. , Have you seriously forgotten the period during which NASA had cancelled the space shuttle program and we were hitching rides on Russian rockets? , Yes they did not have any rockets at all. The plan was to pay Russia to use theirs and they did that for a couple of decades.\\n\\nUSA/NASA could have kept developing rockets but they didn’t want to spend the money so they outsourced. \\n\\nWhat do they teach you kids in school? , If you looked you would see. Start with the Australian battery system I can’t be bothered doing research for you , there are many who do, I think the top post on this thread was talking about how great and misunderstood he was, which is what prompted my own comment. , One or two years ago maybe, but nowadays Elon musk is hated by the majority of redditors , Well this stunt has brought the elon cult out of hiding, watch reddit flip to loving him in the next few weeks because reddit is as flip floppy as a flip flop. , Reddit it totality nope, a bunch of redditors yup , Man that mindset is all over the place and is hilarious, about 14 top post on Reddit per week is Elon hate yet all you see in the comments is people claiming Reddit loves Elon and that their alone in criticizing him. , Uhh yes?\\n\\nMore often than not I see people on reddit treating him like a saint and a hero of all mankind. , Just look at /u/mainguy , Elon used to be a top-tier Reddit golden boy. So yeah, I\\'d wager there are plenty of fans of his here. The zeitgeist didn\\'t do a complete 180.\\n\\nEdit: looking at the comments in here, there is far more Elon defense being upvoted. , He used to be unanimously loved here when the site was way more libertarian. , It used to, 5 years ago. , I mean I’ve used Reddit for more than an hour so, yes , I think it\\'s pretty 50/50 outside of people who hate him for no other reason than him being rich. , He did rent an island that he used to build his company SpaceX. So who knows he might still have that island with an abondoned rocket pad on it . Like that bad guy from Incredibles , He used to own and fly a jet plane; Aero L-39 Albatros.  \\n\\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com.au/elon-musk-flew-military-l39-fighter-jet-trainer-airplanes-2018-8?r=US&IR=T\\n\\nWe\\'ll see his true colors after he becomes king of mars. , I think they seriously didn’t think Putin was actually going to invade. Now that he has they’re sending all sorts of weapons and aid to Ukraine while also greatly increasing they’re own spending. , Natural gas pipeline , For me, seeing developed countries as remaining insensitive against such tragic events, is terrible. If the Developed ones don\\'t take action, then who would? The Ukrainian ambassador said he really cried-after a long time- at the insensitive attitude of the German ambassador. Because Germans thought Ukraine will fall in like 4 hours. It\\'s good to see they are taking Ukraine\\'s side now. Ofc politics and economics are very important in a country\\'s decisions. Everyone acts based on its benefits. And Germany has important deals with Russia. For instance, Simens transfers critical gas turbine technology which is the most needed boost for the Russian defence industry. , Yeah i guess asuming all hell broke loose which it probably will , This is an accurate correction sir. , I think you need to look into past world conflicts. There have been very very many that were immensely unpopular at home that nonetheless continued for many years. The tremendous military machine is calling the shots here. , Lets hope when we all wake up tommorow putin is dead face down in the dirt with a bullet in the back of his head. , \"Go, fuck yourself!\" , And calling the people rescuing children pedos. And promising to manufacture ventilators and not doing it..\\n\\nEtc... , And forcing black people to work in a specific part of his factory they call \"The Plantation...\" , He didn\\'t force people to go back to work though. Anyone who didn\\'t want to go back to work was free to stay home. He just wanted people to be allowed to go back to work, as the government promised. , Calling something Autopilot when it tends to drive you into white semi tractors or emergency vehicles or highway dividers is also pretty sketchy. , Yeah that\\'s the only real questionable thing he ever did.\\n\\nThat and the other dozens of questionable things he did.\\n\\nOr the things his parents did (apartheid emerald mine slaves) to gain their vast wealth in the first place.\\n\\nBut yeah, other than that. Totally just the one thing. , As Florida as shown, the covid mandates made very little to no difference. Florida with almost 0 restrictions has similar trending numbers to other states with severe mandates. , Is that actually true? I though it was against a county directive AFTER the Cali mandate was lifted, and other car plants opened again.\\n\\nHe basically told the County health department they were out-of-step with the state which led to blustering then the county STFU. , He had a point here though. He had permission from the federal and state governments for the Tesla plant to be open and every other automaker in the country was open for business. \\n\\nThe Alameda county health official was the only one who said no, but she honestly was on a bit of a power trip... Most of the workers wanted to work too. , He is neurodivergent and has a clear lack of empathy, which shows in his interactions, but he has a deep drive to help the interests of the Earth and humanity as a whole which far outshines all of his absurdities on Twitter, when you start to realize what his company\\'s are doing to help connect humanity and fight Climate Change. , He made paypal and tesla and spacex and starlink. I think hes allowed to swing a big cocky cock around. , My biggest gripe with the somewhat of a general view of him is that he\\'s trapped in the rich man bad bias and on top of that, unless you really watch podcasts where he\\'s been and some other long-ish form interviews, and you only watch his twitter, yea dude you don\\'t get the full picture and there\\'s plenty of ppl who don\\'t either have time or will to check that bias even once. Nobodys perfect, but he aint some bloody villain. , I am happy he did this. Very much so actually. But the guy also crushes unionization which is quite disgusting. , no wa\\n\\nblinaire bad\\n\\ndonat mor\\n\\nsomething someting joe murugan , I don\\'t know if I would say good. He certainly wants to advance humanity\\'s technology into the future and I personally think overall he\\'s a net positive to the world, but he has done some pretty stupid things over the years. , There’s no such thing as a good billionaire. The only way you become a billionaire is by exploiting other people. , He\\'s a billionaire that did a good deed. Elon himself is not good. That being said I don\\'t care the reasoning for him doing this, I\\'m just glad that he did. Credit where credit is due. , No such thing as a good billionaire , How old are you?\\n\\nI mean either you\\'re a kid, or you\\'re very mentally deficient , Musk didn\\'t offer to open Starlink to Ukraine. Ukraine asked, and Musk delivered. He did nothing here to get attention.\\n\\nMusk didn\\'t offer to open Starlink to Tonga. Tonga asked, and Musk delivered. He did nothing here to get attention.\\n\\nAnd how exactly is Musk \"hoarding wealth\"? He is not some investment banker who is just trying to fill his coffers. His \"wealth\" is all in stock in his own companies. , You\\'ve been snorting the media misinformation cocaine a bit too much. Elon\\'s a dude who has his heart on the right place. A little too much for his own good sometimes. , Here is a simple answer: regardless of what motive he did it for, his action still provide meaningful benefit to Ukraine.\\n\\nYou, sir, what have you done to help the people in the conflict beside getting angry on the internet? , Yeah exactly. Elon Musk fucking sucks as a human being, but hey even a broken clock is right twice a day. , The only reason he\\'s so wealthy is because crazy investors keep buying tsla stock. , And… none of what you said removes the fact that he’s giving Ukrainians the most powerful orbital internet backbone that’s ever been created. I don’t care if he did it to win a bet. He’s helping out Ukraine by providing communications when they need it most. What have you done today other than convince somebody to give you a fake internet medal? , I\\'m going to quote Gordon Ramsay on this one, absolutely delusional , That’s the most negative take I’ve ever read. , What do you not like about him? He’s undeniably one of the most important people living right now , joe fuckin rogan lmao , not always but at least this one he does , Pr and the submarine kids say otherwise. Also everyone waiting 10+ years for self driving cars , A broken clock is still right twice a day. , Just like people believe the earth is flat, there are people who think the cars and rockets aren’t real. , Not me personally, I\\'m not dumb enough to buy into his vaporware. \\n\\nBut for some examples, take all the promises of hyperloop, all the promises of the LV loop and how shit it is in reality, the SolarCity solar roof tyle scam, and so on and so forth. , Reddit hates Elon because he isn’t as politically progressive as the hive mind , People are freakin stupid. , Because all of his ventures have never made money and are only kept afloat by people investing in stock because they believe the conman\\'s promises. , \"Full self-driving\" , I\\'d love an example of 1 product or idea which fulfilled every promise he announced. , Uhh I don\\'t like him because the only reason he\\'s rich is because his parents abused apartheid slaves in their emerald mine in Africa to build their vast wealth.\\n\\nThen Elon inherited the mine.\\n\\nThen Elon bought himself a seat on the board of directors of Paypal and Tesla and then ousted the founders and installed himself as President. Then took credit for all the inventions and ideas of those companies without so much as touching a line of code.\\n\\nNow morons on the internet say he \"founded\" Paypal and Tesla, which he didn\\'t. He bought himself a seat on them with his parent\\'s blood money.\\n\\nAnd reddit cock gobblers run in here to white knight for the billionaire who wouldn\\'t give two shits if they died tomorrow.\\n\\nBut yeah, other than that I don\\'t like him because he tweets weird shit I guess. /s. , Perhaps , Maybe if people didn\\'t idolize loving/hating people in the first place... everyone would see the good as good. People are cultish bc they lack personality and identity. , Nope, I fully expect him to use Ukraine\\'s desperate situation as leverage for himself. , The question is: does this in any way, shape or form rethink your erotic fantasies about him? , Real life Hank Scorpio , That anyone in the area can connect to? Including Russians? It’s still a good thing, just trying to understand. , Charles DuPont and some of the other people who helped America win WWII were assholes, but talented at what they do. , https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/samsung-panasonic-and-tesla-embracing-cobalt-free-batteries-.html\\n\\nThat answer your question?\\n\\nhttps://electrek.co/2020/06/16/tesla-secures-cobalt-deal-controversial-material/\\nHow about that?\\n\\nOr, direct from the horses mouth?\\nhttps://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/about/legal/2018-conflict-minerals-report.pdf , They have ground stations in the surrounding countries (Poland, turkey, etc.) Satellites have a 500 mile max distance range which covers a great deal of the country , I mean, if his egotistical dream is to save the world... , I guess it’s musk since it’s in the name kinda , No different from any other truck delivering aid. Russia has the capability to differentiate so they would be attacking a private company. , I\\'m sorry, I thought the help to Ukraine was obvious so I didn\\'t mention it. , Oh I complete agree with that logic, just would be a cool delivery method. , To recap, you don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. Okay. Hyperloop can be built. It just needs funding. Musk\\'s companies are still a capitalist enterprise.\\n\\nMusk\\'s company set a new speed record, 288 mph in 2019 and Virgin did its first human trial in 2020. Virgin is relevant because Musk is sharing (\\'open sourcing\\') its research findings. , Because this is supposedly Starlink intended for Ukrainians to connect to Internet? , For not wanting to lick Elon Musk\\'s asshole? Give me a fucking break. , Thanks for comnfirming exactly what I just said , I\\'m not sure [it\\'s that simple](https://twitter.com/jsrailton/status/1497745011932286979). , Yes, I\\'m just saying it\\'s important to use them carefully. , Nevermind that SpaceX could put up replacement satellites faster than Russia could shoot them down 😂 , You wouldn\\'t need to knock out anything.  Russia can just blast broadband RF at the starlink constellation and it\\'ll be useless in the region. Starlink satellite positions and frequencies are public knowledge.  I think this is more of a publicity stunt than people realize, and I\\'d bet Musk knows it. , Correct. But all internet is susceptible because it’s a wireless connection. I’m hopeful this is successful but I just dislike the “Without potential for taking down” because it isn’t true. , I don\\'t know the rules on this, but I imagine attacking USA  satellite equipment would be akin to setting foot on NATO soil. Anyone know any better to clarify? , I responded to your other post: it is more complicated/nuanced than that , Just that it needs to be outside and have a clear view of the sky, can be blocked by buildings and easily targeted.\\n\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/ukraine-gets-starlink-internet-terminals-friendly-warning-about-safety-2022-02-28/ , OF course, it all makes sense now. , Thank for the reply! , [deleted] , I know but it\\'s a consideration. I saw a map on sky news of areas controlled by Russia today and it\\'s laughable. Supposedly the 3rd best military on the planet and they\\'re even losing ground to Ukraine. I know the collective West is throwing supplies at them but it\\'s laughable. , Good point. I guess we are about to find out , keep in mind that there are around 2000 of these in orbit.\\nit\\'s literally cheaper for SpaceX to launch 100 than it is for russia to destroy 10. , Oh okay, thank you bud , you mean the cave diver who musk tried to ruin the life of when the diver said elon was wasting his time paddling around in his pool trying to make something never made before as they already had a plan to get the children out?  \\n\\n\\nalso, you wanna give evidence the guy was a pedo? like propper evidence? or should he sue you for slander? give me literal evidence of him being a pedo or stop calling him that , The richest man in the world won a lawsuit against a regular dude? Shocking. , My point is they obviously need the ground terminals to play a role in accessing the link. If the Russians blow them up then there’s no way to connect without other terminals. , Other way around. The terminals communicate with the satellites and then the satellites relay to a ground station with access to an internet provider. If he wanted to he could relay communications from a terminal up to a satellite, relay from satellite to satellite around the earth and finally to a ground station on the other side of the world to connect someone to the internet with no proximity to a ground station. , I\\'m stating facts.  The Russians are preparing to use a thermobaric bomb.  They are bringing up their reserves north of Kyiv supported by Belarus military.\\n\\nLooks like they are going to do a big push over next few days to  encircle Kyiv. , Which he will write off in his taxes. I am donating when I get paid. I am living in poverty, yet I still donate money which I could use to feed myself. Stop treating Elon like a God. , If they had said yes, things would be very different. Maybe SpaceX has a headquarters in Russia.

Why lie? , Elon wanted to do a philanthropic project on Mars. The intention was that it would excite people which would hopefully raise NASA\\'s budget. But he needed to buy old rockets from Russia, and long story short they insulted him and just raised the price. Because of this failure he realized he had to create a rocket company himself instead, which ended up revolutionizing the whole industry and give the Russian space Industry a massive headache as they can\\'t compete with them. , When Elon Musk made his initial fortune from PayPal, he had wanted to buy a surplus ballistic missile to send a small payload to Mars, like a small plant. It would\\'ve been a publicity stunt to encourage the public to take an interest in exploring Mars.\\n\\nAfter several meetings with Russians who may have been able to procure a missile for him, he decided they were just trying to rip him off and gave up. That was his original motivation for starting SpaceX.\\n\\nA few years later, when NASA was starting to look into a replacement for the Shuttle but was still buying launches from Russia for ISS missions, [the Russian deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin, said this](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/trampoline-space-russian-official-tells-nasa-take-flying-leap-n92616):\\n\\n> After analyzing the sanctions against our space industry, I suggest to the USA to bring their astronauts to the International Space Station using a trampoline.\\n\\nTo which Elon Musk replied on Twitter:\\n\\n> Sounds like this might be a good time to unveil the new Dragon Mk 2 spaceship that @SpaceX has been working on w @NASA. No trampoline needed\\n\\nSpaceX has badly outcompeted Russian launches lately, taking a huge portion of the commercial market, including sending astronauts to the ISS. , A link with quotes\\n\\nhttps://www.inverse.com/article/34976-spacex-ceo-elon-musk-tried-to-buy-icbm-rockets-from-russia\\n\\n> Ressi recounted the “Wild West”-like experience to Esquire in 2012. After paying off some corrupt cops on the road to their meeting, Musk’s rocket-buying team arrived at the Russian rocket negotiations, which entailed a lot of vodka quaffing:\\n\\n> “Then we started having meetings with the Russian space program, which is basically fueled by vodka. We’d all go in this little room and every single person had his own bottle in front of him. They’d toast every two minutes, which means twenty or thirty toasts an hour. ‘To space!’ ‘To America!’ ‘To America in space!’ I finally looked over at Elon and Jim and they were passed out on the table. Then I passed out myself.”\\n\\nand\\n\\n> The third and final meeting happened back in Russia. Musk flew there with Cantrell, prepared to purchase three ICBMs for $21 million. But to Musk’s disappointment, the Russians now claimed that they wanted $21 million for each rocket, and then taunted the future SpaceX founder. As Cantrell recounted to Esquire:\\n\\n> “They said, ‘Oh, little boy, you don’t have the money?”\\n\\n> This insulting event, however, played a part in inspiring Musk to found SpaceX, which in 2017 alone has successfully launched nine rockets into space and has twelve more launches on the docket this year. On the flight back, Musk turned to Cantrell and said:\\n\\n> “I think we can build a rocket ourselves.” , Separately from Elon undercutting and embarrassing Russias space program, Tesla does electric cars pretty well and they also do solar. Electrified transportation further undermines Russia by attacking their economy  as hard as SpaceX attacks to their pride. Fossil fuels are a prime export for Russia, and dependence on them gives Russia a lot more negotiating power. Electrification is independence from Russian fossil fuel. , Yeah, thanks.

The user terminal is probably limited by regulations to something like less than 10 W of radiated energy for safety reasons, while the jamming antennas could probably blast many kW of power up.  The jammer could be 1000x as powerful or more. , This guy satellites , How is the GPS currently being jammed in Ukraine? , How many people can use each dish?  Like does it set up a wide area network? , > For this to be really effective, Russia would need to have a jamming drone in between the Dish, and each overhead satellite.\\n\\nYou can also overcome the antenna gain by cranking up the power on your transmitter as the satellites signal strength is really low by the time it reaches the dish. A 10kW transmitter that\\'s within 1000km would have a stronger signal than the satellite unless the receiver dish has at least a 60dB difference from the focal point to the side. , Raspberry! , Starlink is in a low orbit, there isn\\'t much potential for Kessler syndrome. , Taking the constellation down isn\\'t feasible. Way too many satellites, as you said. , Russia does not have anywhere near the capability needed to shoot down that many satellites. , Shooting 1 down would be a declaration of war on the US. , It\\'s more expensive to shoot down a Starlink satellite than to launch one. , It\\'s \\'Ukraine\\' and not \\'the Ukraine\\'\\n\\nConsider supporting anti-war efforts in any possible way: [[Help 2 Ukraine](https://help2ukraine.org)] 💙💛\\n\\n[[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Ukraine)] [[BBC Styleguide](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsstyleguide/u)]\\n\\n^(Beep boop I’m a bot) , I think it was 100W, plus there\\'s heating elements for snow. , Eh if they must wield capitalistic greed, at least harness it for good. , Remember at the beginning of the pandemic when he donated a whole bunch of ventilators to hospitals and he got a bunch of great press, and it turned out they were useless because it was the wrong machine?

Instead of acknowledging all of his successes, you’re saying that if he ever made a SINGLE mistake, EVER, then all of his successes don’t count. How is that remotely fair or a rational way to judge Elon Musk’s contributions to electric vehicles, space travel, digital payment infrastructure, and so forth? , Paypal.  Dummy.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nСлава Героям України!    Glory to the heroes of Ukraine! , Hey troll, what has bill gates done to assist?  Or warren buffet? Or jeff bezos?  Or mark zuckerberg?  Hmmmmm?????\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nСлава Героям України!    Glory to the heroes of Ukraine! , The first two claims are simply untrue. Take a look at [this](https://savingjournalism.substack.com/p/i-talked-to-elon-musk-about-journalism?utm_source=url). Musk\\'s father supposedly owned a stake in one mine located in Zambia, which was not a conflict gem country and was anti-apartheid at the time. The deal lasted around 5 years. Also, he was elected as a city councilor in 1972 with an anti-apartheid affiliation. People have completely blown this emerald thing out of proportion.\\n\\nMusk did not inherit this mine that his father never even owned in the first place. By the time Musk left for Canada when he was 17, his dad no longer held the stake in the mine. The link I posted earlier has a bunch more details.\\n\\nElon\\'s first company was Zip2, and he absolutely did write code for the site. In fact, the website was only online during the day because he only had one computer to host the website on. At night, the website was offline while he worked on it.\\n\\nHe founded X.com after selling Zip2 to Compaq for a few million dollars. X.com eventually merged with Peter Theil\\'s company Confinity. Musk himself was ousted as the CEO and Peter Theil became CEO instead, and the company was renamed to PayPal [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.com).\\n\\nHey, I\\'m not gonna simp for the guy. He\\'s definitely done shitty things. But I\\'m just pointing out the facts with sources. If you\\'re gonna hate Musk, you should hate him for the things that are actually true, not this misinformation. , Exactly the guy I was thinking of! XD , No, you have to have the SpaceX satellite receiver to be able to connect it. \\n\\nThat\\'s what that truck is filled with, the ground satellite receivers. , Unless Russia has reversed engineered the terminal equipment and software to piggyback off it, no, they can\\'t. , [deleted] , His dream is to die on Mars. , They can of course differentiate. What I meant was that all of their systems will still detect it similar to an ICBM headed their way. People might get spooked, think it\\'s secretly an attack, set off false alarms, etc. Just not a great thing to have going on during a moment of high tension where Russia already has their finger over the trigger. , >To recap, you don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. \\n\\nOh man I can\\'t wait for this guy to refute reality and history.. But I notice you didn\\'t refute anything I said.  Nice. \\n\\n>Okay. Hyperloop can be built. It just needs funding. \\n\\nWhy not go over the \"white paper\" they deleted from the website? Also which version can be built?  The one on cussions of air in a vacuum? The one on maglev?  The one with wheels?  The one that carries compressed air? The one that has air in the tube to keep it afloat?  Which version? \\n\\n>Musk\\'s company set a new speed record, 288 mph in 2019 and Virgin did its first human trial in 2020. Virgin is relevant because Musk is sharing (\\'open sourcing\\') its research findings.\\n\\n288mph? Okay but how does a speed test on a limited track scale up to reality? An actual vacuum tunnel with no air.. With a train on.. Air.. (lol) in tunnels which will span the country? Large enough to carry passengers. Of which a single hole will kill everyone in the tube? Reality check. \\n\\nYou buy into what musk says because you want the future to be bright and wonderful like star trek.  Guess what.  Unlike star trek we have to obey the laws of physics.\\n\\nJust think for one moment.  Which version of the loop is possible?  And why? Be specific with technicals.\\n\\nMoney can\\'t change the laws of physics. , Sorry, no offense.  But I\\'m also not a moron.  I just didn\\'t expect you to think they would publish instructions as well as the exact geolocation of the Starlink units here in this unsecure forum.  But it looks like you do think this.\\n\\nI\\'m sure they will be set up locally and your local authorities will provide instructions if there is a unit in your vicinity.  These aren\\'t like a mobile phone tower with a long-range signal which everyone in a neighborhood can connect to.\\n\\nJust as with the other support, it\\'s only accessible if it\\'s either in your neighborhood or if other technologies are connected to it which might provide wider-area coverage (in which case you\\'ll be connecting to the other technology, not directly to Starlink). , no, for being angry and miserable about someone else\\'s success and wealth. It\\'s obviously a projection of an inner hatred. , You’ve said nothing. Its the equivalent of handing them tanks and saying the tanks can be blown up. It’s obvious and doesn’t contribute new information. , Oh it\\'s possible starlink isn\\'t a military system as such but it\\'s not a normal sat system either.\\n\\nIt\\'s a phase array with beam steering etc\\n\\nNote that technology is basically military, starlink is the first commercial use of it. , I dunno, if it was that easy they probably would have already done it. The Russians absolutely wouldn\\'t want Ukraine having high speed internet datalinks out there. , They phased arrayantennas are directional, both for transmit and receive. To jam them as you say, you would need to transmit from within the cell. We don’t know how big each cell is, likely less than 100 km. , Satellite equipment ≠ satellites in space. This was donated equipment from another country and would be no different than a donated tank or plane being shot down. Just because the equipment was provided from an outside entity doesn\\'t make this their equipment.  \\n\\n\\nAttacking another country (or NATO) usually involves crossing a border, engaging military/civilian personnel or specifically a territory held by that country/organization. If equipment was the case all of the US sold/donated equipment across the world used in conflicts would bring us into a lot more wars. , Oops.  Responded to you below the other response to your comment. , for this specific action. just because he does one good thing doesn’t cancel out the bad things, and vice versa. yes this is a great thing, but people aren’t only good or bad. people are allowed to say “hey, he did a good thing this time” , Yes, mother. , Do you have a source on that?\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSource?\\r  \\n\\r  \\nA source. I need a source.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nNo, you can\\'t make inferences and observations from the sources you\\'ve gathered.

A moron. , These terminals are highly mobile, they’re small and all you need is a power outlet. Once they’re distributed there’s not much russia can do to disable it short of tracking each and every one of them down. , > If he wanted to he could relay communications from a terminal up to a satellite, relay from satellite to satellite around the earth and finally to a ground station on the other side of the world \\n\\nThere aren\\'t enough satellites equipped with laser links yet, only the most recent generation in the past few launches have included those. , Ukranians are prepared to die defending their country. They do not want to live under the rule of the new tsarist Russian regime.\\n\\n And the rest of the free world will not forgive Russia in Putin\\'s lifetime. Putin is fucking Russia over. Don\\'t be surprised if Russia is subject to a military coup to remove Putin as Russia\\'s economy begins its downward spiral. , Some things are worth dying for. , I hate to say it, but your donation is not equal in this scenario. Whether or not he claims it on his taxes, he’s still providing a service that will seriously contribute to turning the tides of battle. But it’s okay if you still don’t like him. Nobody says you have to. I’m just giving him credit where it’s due. He could very easily not have done what he did. It’s a reaaaaal stretch to compare my complementing him to worship. , SpaceX wouldn\\'t exist if they had said yes to him back then, he would have spent his money on the PR stunt launch and it would have been gone.  \\nInstead he turned that same money into a hundred billion dollar company. Russia probably regretting that right about now. , So I looked a few of these up but number one does not appear to be true. It shows that his father owned a small stake of a mine in Zambia, where there was no apartheid of course. \\n\\nAnd I know people here in my state that work for him and they are quite happy, grateful even.\\n\\nAs to the others I cannot substantiate them but I don\\'t see him as a particularly evil figure. Hell, this website was collectively worshiping him just a couple of years ago. He was on the front page every day with nothing but praise, then one day it was like a switch flipped. , That\\'s all literally lies that you\\'ve believed. The media is out to destroy Tesla and Musk\\'s reputation for money, and democrats are out to ruin Musk\\'s reputation for votes and you believed every fucking bit of it , People really need to learn nuance and the fact that almost nobody is all good or bad.\\n\\nMusk delivered on this promise, and that\\'s absolutely great.\\n\\nHe\\'s also got some other good things and bad things. , Just don\\'t try to help children or he might call you a paedophile. [Slap every child you see](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hHZvUeAdzeI) and you\\'ll be fine in Elon\\'s eyes. , And my axe , I mean, Tesla employs laborers in close to slave conditions elsewhere, to him this is a marketing stunt. Ukraine should gladly appreciate such donations I am sure, but not everyone helping Ukraine right now is automatically a good person. , This one delivers though. , elon\\'s aight.\\n\\nshitty tweets small price to pay for better space and electric cars , It\\'s already [ in the plans](https://www.thedrive.com/content-b/message-editor%2F1602689463554-ekqus3huwaa3mum1.jpeg) to use Starship for military cargo delivery , Can someone please explain to me why it\\'s acceptable to supply weapons but not soldiers??? I don\\'t get it... , It’s the asswhole world vs Russia already, bc it has geopolitical ramifications that affect everyone even more than when Germany took territory and it caused WWII.  For now, they’re all just letting the Ukrainians do the work & keeping it on Ukrainian soil.  But another escalation or two, it won’t be long and other nations “volunteers” will start arriving to help train on all the new equipment starting to show up.  As long as Putin breathes, it’s absolutely WWIV. , I believe Ukraine has a standing military of 1.2 million and the invading Russian force is 200k .Russian troops that don\\'t want to be there and have military rations that expired in 2015 for food. Ukraine is getting help with money, weapons, tools and 17000 volunteer troops from 27 countries. While I agree it\\'s not a worldwide \"boots on the ground\" but it definitely has an impact. , There are independent troops/groups from all over the world arriving or on the ground. \"EU and USA does not have any one in Ukraine\", 🤫 , From what I’m seeing, completely agree.  Might even be easier than Afghanistan , > and for some weird reason west doesn’t use metric.\\n\\n... Yes they do. , That makes sense. Sorry for the misunderstanding. , What a mornonically asinine thing to say in reply to a nuanced view. , Bro. Chill. Suicide isn\\'t a crime to begin with. If somebody truly wants take their own life and has thought through it, that is their right as a human. They own their consciousness and have every right. People who think they might be impacted by their death more then they are by being alive... you lack compassion and empathy for them and didnt/couldnt do all you could to ease their suffering enough to keep them alive\\n\\n\\nEdit: and yea you are from Texas. That explains it 😂 , Women are always the primary victims in war! , what if he got bayonetted in the ass , Oh they\\'re out there. Mostly it\\'s just russia bots claiming crisis actors.\\n\\nThat 14 year old girl with her legs blown off was *clearly* faking it. , I saw comments saying it was all planned by Biden. It’s out there bro , Ok, here\\'s mine (stressing out it\\'s a bit far fetched). \\n\\nRussian nationalism is extremely insecure and Putin is a narcissist.Trump knew being a massive fan boy, would calm them down. Or he didn\\'t, but it still had that effect. The praise felt so good to the fragile egos, that they ignored objectively more important issues like weapon/financial support to Ukraine, US energy independence & export, push to increase NATO budget, opposition to NS2, arming the Sauds who hate Assad etc.\\n\\nI heard the idea from Scott Adam\\'s who suggested the current admin is too dumb to understand this mentality. But what if they\\'re not? What if they knew exactly which buttons to press so Putin made a massive mistake?\\n\\nIt\\'s easy too see the incentive. Russia is being humiliated and isolated on the international stage. The putin-philes in the US looks like fools, while the administration looks like statesmen on the side of freedom fighters without endangering Americans. Not only is the West coming together, but much of the rest of the world too. Europe is more dependent on US energy exports and drastically increases military budgets. China sits on the outside, because they can\\'t really criticize Russia, but they can\\'t condone it either. Yes, they get a new gas station, but that is of declining worth in tomorrow\\'s world. Western hostility towards Russia will also cause us to see the CCP as a threat, which means the countermeasures will be taken sooner rather than later when we are weaker in relative terms. , That\\'s how you know they\\'re getting away with it. , I’ve seen a few questioning if this is even happening. Or that this is just a distraction for something bigger happening. , [deleted] , This is just to distract you from the fact that Elon is not a human. , There is going to a lot of false stuff out there, but seeing so any countries work together and just stand up to Putin so long and so much. It’s nice to see, late, but nice to see. , What I\\'ve seen on Reddit is mostly people complaining he\\'s just doing this for the atttention,, and that it doesn\\'t really mean much. Also, before today, people complaining \"what good is this!? They don\\'t have the equipment to use it!\" , Echo chambers and algorithms.  Gotta search it out if you want to find differing ideas. , Don\\'t go to 4chan lol , Search for \"biolab\" on twitter or reddit. The morons are definetely out there trying their best. , [deleted] , Starlink Profitability Projection Final Updated (V4.2).xlsx , I think they have said they could eventually reach $30B/yr in revenue. \\n\\nAt $100/month that would be 25 million customers. … in the US alone like 20 million people/households still don’t have access to internet > 3 Mbps… , Of course they did but that isn\\'t what the person you replied to was saying. , I assume it won\\'t be free forever. , Elon was asked to do this by a Ukrainian official. I guess damned if you do and damned if you don’t. , These dishes will be used to feed mesh networks and connect tens of thousands of people who can get word of mouth to their surroundings. \\n\\nYou\\'re a dumbass. , Wow. That is just hilarious and impressive , Wow, that is hilarious.  More like shooting yourself in the leg. , Adding: the \"Trampoline\" joke was tweeted out by Rocosmos when NASA started to contract with SpaceX, saying they would have better luck resupplying the ISS by trampoline. , I totally forgot this... Oh, yeah if I remembered correctly he wanted to buy one of the old USSR ICBM... , He was negotiating for several rockets when he only had a few million. I think they were asking for 20 million a rocket and he was offering like 6 million for three lol. This was prior to the PayPal buyout. Elon only made \\\\~22 million from Zip2 , r/pettyrevenge , That\\'s fucking hilarious.\\n\\nCompletely off tangent : Reminds me when icefrog approached blizzard for Dota 2, they told him they\\'re not interested, so he went to valve got a limitless cheque and here we are today. , Oh so ultimately they hate him because of jealousy. Ok got it. , I\\'m going to make my own rocket company. With Blackjack. And Hookers! , Capitalism always wins, baby. , This is a prime example of “respect the guy sweeping the mess, he could be the foreman for the next job”. , Hadn\\'t really thought about it but Russia would have quite a bit of leverage with being the only one who can transport ppl to the ISS if not for SpaceX... , Wow... that\\'s some next level grudge to start 4 companies in 4 industries for the purpose of fucking over another country. , I think you can edit your autocorrect. , All bilionaires are evil dipshits, Elon Musk is not the exception. However even bad men can do good things , I expected it, but imagine simping for billionaires on the internet 🤣. , Here come the Elon haters. , u/OSUfan88 I\\'m genuinely curious how useful Starlink is in a conflict zone :P , Haha, that would be great! , That was my only thought. I’m not going to lie. , I read that and instantly imagined jam running down the screen of someone on the internet. , ... Raspberry! , I’m right here with you. , From a quick google search, starlink uses a propeitary network protocol. But I can speculate from my experience that the satellite ephemeris is one of the fields in the data frame. The data frame can be encrypted an probably is at a minim level. There are other ways of getting satllite location, but these commercial terminals probably just do it over the air. Terminals can also scan the sky for satellites. A terminal can log on to a satellite just by following the RF energy emitted by the satellite. \\n\\nA sophistacted jammer can determine RF sources and determine their locations so they wouldnt need to decode the traffic. \\n\\nAnd if a terminal can find and log onto a satellite, a jammer can as well. , For starlink both the dish and the satellites have phased array antennas, so it\\'s directional both ways. I\\'m not sure how the physics plays out here, and whether the dishes can filter out a kW jamming signal, but maybe. However that would require the Russian to be in line of sight to the dishes, which isn\\'t going so well for them. Jamming the satellites is also a problem because there are many and they move fast, plus I\\'m sure we\\'d hear about it if the satellites themselves were interrupted.\\n\\nAlso the dishes use 50W and the previous models were bigger with more radio chiplets and used 100W. They even use the radio chips as heating elements to melt snow, so they\\'re pretty hefty on radio power.\\n\\n(Since you\\'ll probably be wondering how on earth they establish a connection in the first place, I think the satellites beam signals to a hexagonal grid below their path, and I assume once they connect with a dish in a certain hex they beam the signal there more often.) , Not really. , GPS is really easy to jam. Any low power L band emitter can jam GPS. Its a problem for airports. , This is a bit of a subjective question. One would be good for setting up a TV for a large room of people to disseminate news which would probably be what its used for. , Lone Star....! , So? , that’s just it though. if musk thought he’d move more units helping russia, he would. great it worked out this time. but it’s not altruism. , But these arent ventilators, these are starlink dishes, these are used already, all over the world with great success. I know people out in the boonies who love theirs, they worked in Germany after the floods, and work now in Tonga after the volcano.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to give him the benefit of the doubt, but these are working products. , I don\\'t see that much that could go wrong here but hey I guess we\\'ll see. And again I fucking hate Elon. , You’re good! , Musk is a weirdo and has a lot of issues (both moral and legal),  his companies also make cool shit. , What you call fraud is your average sales team in any tech company. Sales have a reputation of promising things that don\\'t exist and then demand we deliver. , Maybe they weren\\'t frauds? There\\'s an enormous difference between being wrong, which he\\'s admitted about FSD, and commiting fraud.\\n\\nFraudsters NEVER produce anything of real value. Tesla cars exist, and are engineering marvels, the same with SpaceX. People don\\'t suddenly one day choose to fraud people and then again produce products people love. Fraudsters are always fraudsters. Neuralink may potentially fail, though I\\'m very optimistic, but if they do it still wouldn\\'t mean it was a fraud. I mean, he\\'s just losing a lot of money on Neuralink unless they actually release a great product. , As a Tesla driver, FSD is definitely a scam (even if the intention to succeed is there), but neuralink and boring company are more just companies that haven\\'t lived up to their promise. That describes a ton of companies. But especially as those two aren\\'t public companies, there is definitely no fraud. My firm promises all kinds of half baked technology solutions to clients.   \\n\\nMusk\\'s obsession with publicly discussing TSLA\\'s stock price and crypto is ridiculous. It\\'s almost like he wants to get fucked by the SEC. , Overhyping != fraud , Self-driving fraud? , Wait, what\\'s the self driving fraud? Nearly shit myself the first time my friends Tesla decided to switch lanes, use the blinker and do a left turn all on its own in a busy city intersection. , i think your definition of fraud is fraudulent. , \\n\\nHes an inovator because he TRIES everything not because it works the first time. Most of science is leaning from your mistakes. , > neuralink fraud, and the boring company fraud\\n\\nWhat? , Nothing you said is considered fraud , I’ll give you the first few but how are neuralink or the boring company fraud when they aren’t even traded. Aren’t they fully owned by him? , How is Neuralink fraud? They actually have a working chip.\\n\\nHow is The Boring Company fraud? They actually delivered on the Vegas Loop as promised.\\n\\nWhat stock and crypto manipulation?\\n\\nThe future self-driving already exists, and people are using it. It is just unifinished right now.\\n\\nYou have some weird definition of fraud, where fraud involves actually delivering. Are you Russian, by any chance? , Bruh every company overpromise and it is not exclusive to tesla. Tesla delivers, late, yes but it eventually does. FSD is ahead of every self driving service right now if you ignore the claims of the main stream media and look into the videos of actual fsd testers. There is also no stock manipulation or crypto manipulation. He has the freedom of speech and can say whatever he wants. And neuralink will start human trials this year. Where is the fraud? Apple, samsung, google, etc all promise stuff but never deliver. Tesla does it late but it gets it done before anyone else. There is a reason why tesla has already moved to ev mass production of a million vehicles per year while others are capping out at a few thousand , Don\\'t forget the worker abuse, covid misinformation passed on JRE episode 1470, wealth from apartheid emerald mines, several billions in tax subsidies he has recieved, and his hostile take over of tesla from the founders. , That\\'s interesting. I\\'m not saying you\\'re wrong, but do you have a source for that? I\\'d love to read more about it. \\n\\nWhat I\\'ve read says the opposite, but what I\\'ve read could be wrong. , Source? , Yeah after watching the NatGeo doc called The Rescue about this event, there was absolutely no way one of those subs could fit through some of those spots they had to travel through. , He even hired an investigator with an extensive criminal record to go after the diver. , > because it genuinely wouldn’t have, Elon was just trying to look good\\n\\nDo we really know that? \\n\\nElon made a bunch of rocket scientists stop working on rockets and started to try to figure out how to save those kids in the cave. \\n\\nHe talked to the people on the rescue operation who kinda said it would be a great idea. \\n\\nAll rocket engineers started to work like 24/7 coming up with a solution. From his companies salary. \\n\\nEveryone of them flew to Thailand, hired a huge place where they could do tests and worked hard as hell. \\n\\nThen they came to the scene and were told to fuck off. \\n\\nI don\\'t remember anyone on team Elon was publicly mad about that. \\n\\nLater the diver said on a interview Elon only did it for clout. \\n\\nMedia bashed Elon for trying to do it. \\n\\nI imagine Elon was pissed off at him because he was trying to make something good.  And called him a pedo to make a point that Diver don\\'t know why Elon is doing what he is doing. And Elon don\\'t know why Diver is in Thailand.  \\n\\nThe logic is if Diver knows Elon did it for clout, then Elon knows Diver goes to Thailand for children. \\n\\nBut for some reason no one got that. \\n\\nSo all we remember is Elon calling a Diver pedo.\\n\\nedit: I know I know, people who defends him are pathetic. People who talks shit about him are heroes.\\n\\nedit2: Don\\'t fucking attack post  i replied to by reporting him to crisis line. Fucking idiots. Use crisis line for people you really think have a hard time. Not people you don\\'t agree with. , This is not true and you should stop answering questions you don\\'t know the answer to.\\n\\n\\nIt was not a diver. It was a British citizen who had moved to Thailand and was a hobby cave mapper. He was only used by the real rescue team so they could get and idea of the cave, that he had mapped in dry conditions in his free time.\\n\\nThe official/real rescue team asked Elon for help and Elon spent time and money to help.\\n\\nThe hobby cave mapper said in an interview that Elon could stick his submarine up in his ass (unprovoked) and then someone posing as a private detective contacted Elon and told him, that he had proof that he was a pedophile.\\n\\nYes yes Elon shouldn\\'t have called him that, but eh we are all humans and we make mistakes. , The diver told Elon to stick his sub up his ass, not that it was useless.  \\nAnd Elon was talking with the people in charge who told him it was worth a shot.  \\nGrown men calling each other names over twitter is still pretty pathetic. , Elon fanboys don\\'t like it because it\\'s [hugely misleading](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommonSenseSkeptic/comments/pm4egc/elon_musk_called_a_rescue_diver_in_thailand_pedo/).\\n\\nThe guy who was called pedo wasn\\'t on the actual rescue team. At the time, after the actual rescue team had asked Musk for help and sent him the specifications for the sub, there was a barrage of constant attacks on him from everywhere for some reason. When this guy attacked him live on TV, I guess that\\'s what broke the camel\\'s back, and he posted that \"pedo guy\" tweet.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it was a \"hissy fit\" as much as he was fed up with all the attacks and accusations when all he did was to respond to a call for help from the rescue team.\\n\\nAlso, the guy wasn\\'t much of a hero. Not only was he not on the rescue team (all he did was point the rescue team to where they could look), but it was later found that he had been talking shit about the actual rescue divers, and said he wanted them to suffer because they got more attention than him.\\n\\nSo guess what, things aren\\'t always as simple as you might think. , [deleted] , >Crisis line\\n\\nI\\'m one of the people you call \"Elon fanboy\".  \\n\\nI don\\'t like people using Crisis line.   \\n\\nWrite to them you think you have been attacked by trolls.\\n\\nSomeone once told me they actually do stuff about people using that for the wrong reasons. , which crisis line? , The government and people in charge of the rescue operation asked him to continue work on the sub. It was a random volunteer cave diver who had no say in any of the decision making that told him to shove it up his ass. , FYI the guy wasn\\'t a cave diver, it was just a guy who went into the cave and had familiarity with it. , “respectfully” told him to shove his submarine up his ass , The rescue team never turned him down, they worked with him on it. \\n\\nIt was a British* *advisor* to the rescue team who, unprovoked, told Elon to shove a submarine up his ass. , The government and people in charge of the rescue operation asked him to continue work on the sub. It was a random volunteer cave diver who had no say in any of the decision making that told him to shove it up his ass. , And as the comments say below, it wasn\\'t turned down by the government, and it wasn\\'t respectful. , This is not true and you should stop answering questions you don\\'t know the answer to.\\n\\nIt was not a diver.

Still to be honest I don’t expect an evacuation to be necessary. , Totally agree, the Russian Cosmonauts have always stayed clear of politics, not necessarily Ruscosmos but the Cosmonauts.\\n\\n[Because reasons](https://i.imgur.com/KIysnPJ.jpg) , I misspoke. Elon DID NOT say he would evacuate ISS, but rather take over certain functions on ISS that are currently managed by the Russians. I would be that he could evacuate them, though. , But you know the other astronauts prob now have a contingency plan if the Cosmonauts try something. I think the cosmonauts are more\\nLikely to defect or seek asylum than sabotage , That\\'s an interesting predicament , so can we keep the cosmonauts as POWs? , oh jeez. war in space? sounds like a job for space force , I don\\'t think there\\'s any suggestion that they would take over the ISS. Just maybe that they\\'d return early. While I can see that (maybe 5% chance), and don\\'t think they\\'d do it without offering for the US astronaut a ride on it back. , I don\\'t think this is true. They always have enough seats for everyone to immediately evacuate. Even when they briefly relocate a capsule from one node to another they load up all of the astronauts assigned to it while moving it. This way there are always enough return seats on capsules immediately available to use even for the brief time a capsule is relocating. , Not just a thought, it was a weakly vailed threat by Dmitry Rogozin the director of Ruscosmos. (Side tangent: the same nerd who a few years ago mocked SpaceX and pondered if the USA wouldn’t have better luck using a trampoline to get to the ISS if they don’t want to hitch a ride with RU…. ~2-3 years later talking with SpaceX about booking Cosmonauts on Crew Dragon)\\n\\nWhere in a Twitter tantrum he asked who is going to save the ISS if it de-orbits and crashes in America or Europe?\\n\\nAnd Elon replied simply with an image of the SpaceX logo. , This is the answer. I misspoke. Elon DID NOT say he could evacuate ISS, but I believe he could. , I don\\'t disagree, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not also in his best interests. , While I don\\'t disagree with you in principle, I have to mention that without those contracts with NASA and USAF, he wouldn\\'t be able to fund his far-reaching vision of the humankind in space. , > He doesn\\'t need some contract for him to do what he feels is in the interest of mankind.\\n\\nLook, I don\\'t think Elon is a complete monster, but the dude isn\\'t some fucking Tony Stark hero. Get his cock out of your mouth, it\\'s embarrassing. , \"in the interest of mankind\"\\n\\nFucking lol. , Look my man it\\'s no secret reusing rockets bring the price down you don\\'t  have to be a genius for it, and for the prices part i didn\\'t mean old launches i meant estimated SLS cost aswell as ariane-5 and other modern currently in use rockets\\n\\n\\nAnd just a friendly reminder that spaceX is a team of engineers not only Elon sitting alone in a room , Any government thing really, the amount of wasted money on bureaucracy is mind boggling. , Yes? nothing has changed for NASA. Reusability is king , Ok then compare it to SLS launches, SpaceX is still vastly cheaper. , Compare spacex to literally anything else , It’s not. They’re in a cult. , It\\'s not, that person has elon\\'s dick in his mouth. , Go compare *any* launches to spacex , Cutting costs =/= reducing safety necessarily. \\n\\nNASA spends a comical amount of money on developing anything. Because nasa is a bureaucracy they spend ridiculous amounts of money inefficiently. SpaceX is much much more cost-effective. , Yes, if we’re going to make it affordable for people to explore space, then we need to figure out cost savings. , Like the other guys said there\\'s bureaucracy, but also getting things to space is fucking expensive, like $3000/lb is a good deal expensive, so reducing that cost means we can put more things into space on the same budget. , NASA gives us a lot of cool shit. Think of all the probes, rovers, and technologies they\\'ve invented. Some of humanity\\'s greatest achievements came from space programs with Soviets with the first satelitte, first person in space, first space walk I believe, and first to have a human orbit the planet. The US with multiple moon landings, probes to other planets, deep space probes like Voyager 2. Before I forget, the Soviets sent a probe that landed on Venus and actually survived for a little bit. I think it has the only surface photos of Venus. Nasa\\'s probe that was throw into Jupiter to be destroyed to prevent possible contamination of anything in the future, it survived 150 km into the depths of Jupiter, giving amazing readings the whole way.\\n\\nSo yeah, lots of cool shit. But it\\'s part of the government, and an extremely visible part of the government. To get funding, they have to create a meticulously detailed document and submit to...Congress I believe. Who can yay or nay. And once a project has been approved, NASA operates under certain restrictions, a lot of them being safety restrictions that were unfortunately written in blood. They have to used the approved designs, even if another way is cheaper or more efficient because it\\'s a proven idea that has worked.\\n\\nSpaceX is far more nimble. They have a much larger selection of missions, decide their own budget, use whatever design they prefer, etc. I\\'m not saying SpaceX is less safe than NASA, just that they have far more wiggle room when it comes to deciding to use what when going over safety measures.\\n\\nThat\\'s the way I\\'ve heard it explained, at least. , I didnt even mention re usable rockets in my post. You dont need reusable rockets to make a much safer and much cheaper ride to the ISS. The old soyuz is both a way cheaper and safer, so just a plain better way to get astronauts to the iss compared to the space shuttle. And the new astronaut ride to the iss that boeing is making also has no reusable rocket parts. \\n\\nAfter the space shuttle was cancelled, roscosmos increased the price of their ride to space for americans, and it was still cheap compared to space shuttle.\\n\\nBut also, without spacex, I am 100% convinced that humanity still wouldve never shot a single thing up to space using a reusable rocket booster. and im pretty sure nasa didnt help them with engine design, landing legs design or software required for landing a rocket.\\n\\nthe existence of space shuttle probably helps spacex with their starship tho, they can look at the problems that the shuttle had and try to avoid those. Like building a way more cost effective heat shield. Also the heat shield of crew dragon was based on earlier heat shields. , It might\\'ve if Ukraine was invaded before he donated, instead he provided free Internet to the entire country. Do you literally have nothing better to do than shit on someone who has helped millions of people more than you ever will in your entire life? , To add to that all the cronyism.  Lots of deals were made  for CA HSR. All of them were to enrich someone, not to provide fast reliable transportation. , Oh, lookie here.  Man-child edits the post to put in even more juvenile shit.    Sweet. , When the official rescue team asked him to work on it, it likely was pretty helpful.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t call any actual rescuer a pedophile. He called a volunteer for pedophile, a volunteer who had no part in decision making and was only there to help because he walked the cave in his free time. , And you\\'re trying to direct attention to you right now.  Shut up.  This is about helping Ukraine.\\n\\nYou\\'re worse than him; you\\'re not even showing legit receipts while you\\'re blabbing away up in here.  And you\\'re eating crow from me chopping away at your bullshit show. , You are wrong. The rescue team asked him for help (the government too and lots of random dudes on Twitter) svd asked him to continue the work on the sub.\\n\\nThen unsworth a hobby cave mapper/explorer said to Elon to stick the sub in his ass. , And how many starlink devices is that, exactly. 100? Ukrainian military and government have their own telecom solutions and aren\\'t about to use consumer hardware, it\\'s a security risk as well as probably not integrated with whatever systems they have. \\n\\nAlso worth pointing out that Starlink users now have a pretty strong microwave beacon pointing straight up, and it\\'s pretty trivial to target those, and Russia\\'s good at it. They killed Dzhokhar Dudayev, the Chechen president at the time all the way back in 1996 by locking in to his satellite phone, which is far less bandwidth/power than a starlink satellite transmitter/receiver. Worst case scenario is that now there\\'s a hundred targets, clear as day all over rooftops in Kiev. , The cockroaches come out at the drop of a cookie. , More sexual references?  What\\'s wrong with you, coming into r/ukraine to take a diarrhea dump? , No, people like him don’t know much about what they cry about , I’m not musk cult lol. I could of thrown more adjectives in there like narcissistic or pompous I guess, but figured why on a good deed post? The hate musk cult are wild , Yep. And put a ground station in Fiji and shipped dishes to Tonga to help them after the volcano. , Sure. We\\'re on Reddit though so of course this post is going to devolve into people sucking him off and people tearing him down. Personally, I very much dislike Musk, but this thing he did here is a good thing. That\\'s all it should be. , Except steve jobs didnt electrocute elephant to prove a (incorrect) point. , Indeed, America can now launch rockets. Thanks to SpaceX and other private companies. , That\\'s because there is no reddit hive mind and saying that is silly. There\\'s clearly different groups on Reddit. , No doubt it’ll be a complete 180 a few weeks from now , that\\'s called independent thought and opinions :) wow , it\\'s almost as if he has done both good things and bad and it\\'s almost as if there are different people posting different things on reddit , Yeah, reddit is left wing but also really into tech and such, so Elon more than maybe anyone else really polarizes the community. , Hivemind implies conscious thought.  It\\'s more like a field of sunflowers following the light. , Yeah there is no reddit hive mind , Bro, there is no reddit hive mind.\\n\\nReddit has 430 million monthly active users. You really think there\\'s a hive mind? No.\\n\\nIf you see one post praising Elon, that doesn\\'t mean Reddit likes Elon. That means the people who like Elon are upvoting a post about Elon.\\n\\nWould you say there\\'s a hivemind in the USA about Biden being the best? No you wouldn\\'t because that makes no sense.\\n\\n\\nSorry for sounding aggressive. Rough day. love you. , The reality of a lot of arguments is always somewhere in the middle. He has done a lot of good for humanity, unfortunately he can be extremely immature and has some undeniable criticism regarding his business practice. , It\\'s almost as if people have a different opinion about him and both reach front page. So weird. , Almost like people are complex and can\\'t be described entirely by a single event at all times.\\n\\nLove or hate a person they can still do good or bad. , Elon is a cunt.  Always has been a cunt. Will continue to be a cunt. \\n\\nAssuming this starlink business works then he did something right. \\n\\nStill a cunt though. , Ah right, it was such a secret that Elon was a rich person. , Probably has to do more with Elon Musk supporting a coup in a foreign country, and when called out on it his response was: \"we will coup whoever we want! Deal with it!\" , People like to say Elon has a little cult going, but honestly, from the perspective of someone who doesn\\'t give a shit, the massive hate boner trends are more cultish than any positive posts I\\'ve seen about the guy. , Now you’re projecting your own beliefs onto others. , You’d call a dude who rescued kids a pedo because you were called narcissistic? I feel like the response isn’t proportional and you’re trying (and failing) to downplay it. It was fucked up. It showed that he was an egotistical prick. Calling him a whiny baby and bringing up the autism spectrum just diminishes the level of responsibility this grown ass billionaire has over his actions. , \\n>I\\'d be pissed too if I was offering help and someone called my efforts stupid and narcissistic.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a narcissist like musk you might.\\n\\nI can\\'t believe you\\'re defending that. Especially trying to pin it on Autism, that\\'s a really shitty thing to do. , > Doesn\\'t make it right, but it\\'s far more understandable than people make it out to be.\\n\\nIs using slave labor in African emerald mines understandable too?\\n\\nHow about working your employees to death and paying them low wages and treating them worse than Amazon warehouse workers? , He is a dick, lmao. What has he done that is altruistic? , Is there nowhere safe from the Elon boot lickers. , Reposting /u/Vecii comment\\n\\nHe didn\\'t call \"people\" pedos. He called one guy a pedo, who took it upon himself to go to the media and talk shit about Musk who was just trying to help. Unsworth was also on record talking about making the actual divers \"suffer for leaving him out of the loop\" and was talking about movie deals and money the whole time. Unsworth is hardly a hero and had very little involvement with the rescue. Richard Stanton was one of the lead rescuers and was in direct contact with Musk and told him to continue working on the mini-sub. \\n\\nSource for links.\\n\\nAs for the ventilators, Tesla built some prototypes for the government, but the government decided not to buy them from Tesla. This wasn\\'t Musk not delivering on a promise, this was the government saying that they didn\\'t need them. , And yet other US auto manufacturers managed it just fine. , https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/tesla-faces-california-lawsuit-after-allegations-of-racism/ , 🙄 , Sorry, should have phrased it as, lack of conventional empathy by neurottypical standards. , So many lies this counts as Misinformation , The first part of your comment is very innacurate, he used some of his parents emerald slave money (less than a million dollars and closer to 100k, most of the funding for the company came from angel investors) to start a company called zip2 which was sold for several hundred million. He used the money from that sale to create X.com which merged with another company to become PayPal (X.com was also very successful at this time). During the merger musk became CEO and started to force a transition to windows software instead of Linux. Peter Theil, the owner of the other company that had merged to become PayPal resigned in protest at this decision. When the transition started causing technical problems, the board replaced musk with Theil again, before it was sold to eBay and musk made billions from his remaining shares. He never \"bought his way in\" to PayPal after it was already founded, he was instrumental in its creation. \\n\\nI\\'m not even going to read the rest of your comment since you seem very keen on spreading misinformation. , take your hate someplace else. This man is trying to ensure people in a country invaded during peacetime have access to a fundamental human right. If you wanna make a tirade against musk fuck off and do it somewhere else. , bitches gonna bitch , Let’s break this down here.\\n\\nElon’s father owned a few shares in a Zambian emerald mine that went belly-up. Elon disliked his father strongly, as did his mother and siblings. He and his siblings moved to Canada, then America, away from him, where they had to work manual jobs for a while.\\n\\nElon and his brother made Zip2, which they sold off for a few million.\\n\\nElon then started working on PayPal with a few other guys, the sale of which brought him a boatload of cash.\\n\\nSpaceX, which he is the Chief Engineer of btw, was founded when the Russians tried to price-gouge him in a deal for one of their rockets. About half of his post-PayPal cash went into funding it, and he almost went broke because of it.\\n\\nStarlink was founded to provide faster satellite internet to poor and rural areas while also funding SpaceX.\\n\\nMusk was one of the first ten employees at Tesla, being an early investor (he sank the other half of his post-PayPal money into Tesla), ended up in charge of the business side of things. At the time, it was led by a guy who kept trying to make deals with other car companies promising to make electric versions of their cars. These promises were lies, which Musk soon found out. Musk then took over Tesla and set it on the right track. \\n\\nAs for your claims that Elon takes all of the credit for designing shit, find me, say, give examples of the man himself taking credit and not accrediting the teams at SpaceX, Tesla, The Boring Company, or Neuralink. It is others who say he invented shit, while he himself always accredits entire teams for their accomplishments. , This is what watching Hasan Piker on Twitch does to a man\\'s brain , No bitches ? , Elon is way too smart to have been a nobody forever. I’m pretty sure he would’ve eventually found his way. The super genius always do , hey hey careful now. Dont wanna get accused of suckin on that elon dong , Yes exactly. It’s easy for us to cast judgement on all these famous people who live under a microscope. I think people would be more empathetic if every time they made a oopsie it was publicized for the world to see. , > he biggest difference between us and Elon is billion$. His stupid is on a much bigger scale and everyone is watching.\\n\\nYeah on the opposite side of that though I don\\'t have a yacht, or a private airplane, and I don\\'t get to snort top end cocaine off a thousand dollar hooker\\'s ass crack.\\n\\nBut poor billionaire Elon Musk. His Mommy and Daddy used slaves in emerald mines in Africa to build their vast fortune and now he\\'s the inheritor of billions and has to... *checks notes* deal with a little internet criticism. **GASP**. , He\\'s also done some scummy things in the past. I think he\\'s trying to make the world a better place, and I definitely applaud many of the things he\\'s done, but he also has a huge ego that he needs to feed. , Especially considering how close SpaceX was to bankruptcy at one point (I think 2009?). , Almost did make him bankrupt, twice. , When did Elon do this? , He would always be rich but his insane wealth is from the tsla stock being worth more than the top 6 auto manufacturers combined. , Actually it\\'s because his parents used apartheid slaves in their emerald mines in Africa and Elon inherited the mine.\\n\\nThat\\'s where all his wealth came from, in case you\\'re not educated on the topic which seems pretty clear. , Correct. Almost all of his ideas are complete dogshit. , If I buy a bunch of lottery tickets and win, am I a sane investor or just lucky?\\n\\nAlso, it\\'s not likely for tsla to stay so high forever unless you think they\\'re going to be the only auto manufacturer in existence. , That\\'s hilarious , Already replied to someone else about the hyper loop. \\n\\nAnd yeah the tunnels are kind of silly, but so far not hurting anyone so who am I to judge what industries he feels he can eventually disrupt. \\n\\nPersonally I think it’s mainly prep for his mars colony where the boring machines will be used to dig habitats, so any earth based funding he can get to learn and perfect it is the reason. , The boring tunnel really isn’t that bad of an idea. The proof of concept is pretty much in things you use all the time. Namely computer communication protocols. \\n\\nIt’s a pipe. It’s the traveler’s speed is largely dictated by the input and output speeds. The output rate happens to be fairly easy to increase by having the tunnel exit into multiple exit lanes. I.e. if cars start jamming in a tunnel build more places for the cars to unload. Rather than have four unload lanes have 8, and you’ve effectively doubled its output rate. If cars come in every 30s, but it takes 60s to unload passengers and free up the lanes you only need 2 lanes to ensure that you have no backups. Add in a buffer of maybe 5 unloading lanes and you have a very small chance of ever having a traffic build up on the output. \\n\\nThus really the biggest limiting reagent for traveling speeds is the loading time. Which likely isn’t going to be that big. It can be reduced by adding more tunnels, longer cars, etc., but I just don’t really see that as being that big of a wait. Definitely not longer than the wait for a subway or the wait for a ride service + traffic. \\n\\nOnce the cars are in the tunnel, they can travel virtually as fast as possible (obviously some limitations for safety reasons) in a straight line. This makes the travel much quicker than on a road above the surface. A self driving car (which is the end goal here), should be able to drive a straight line quickly and safely, fairly easily. \\n\\nAs it is Tesla’s self driving feature appears safer than human driver’s, but it seems like they’re still waiting on using the self driving feature for the boring tunnels. In a couple of years I’d assume it would be implemented and the speeds could probably be increased. \\n\\nAs for comparing it to the modes of transport. The cost in Vegas is cheaper than an Uber/Lyft ride to the passenger, and likely quicker. Compared to a subway, the cost of building the tunnel and the cars is at least a whole order of magnitude cheaper. It also takes several years fewer. I also think it would be nicer to take a self contained car than be out in public with a bunch of strangers on a subway, but that’s just me. \\n\\nLogistically it’s not perfect yet, but it does have some unique advantages over other forms of transportation. I think it’ll be interesting to see how it works and is improved over the next couple of years. , Hyperloop is definitely feasible. I mean it\\'s just a 3rd industry and he profits from digging for government and he also uses it to do work for SpaceX. It\\'s just an aspiration it\\'s not a con. , > So, let\\'s just start with the impractical hyperloop, or should we talk about how his boring tunnels, you know, single lanes traffic jams, but underground...\\n\\nOf all the capital he\\'s invested, you\\'re focusing on maybe 0.2%? If that?\\n\\nHe has a few hobby projects he\\'s funded and is interested in, but the hard reality is that he has two companies he actually runs in any meaningful way: Tesla and SpaceX\\n\\nAnd while he\\'s made some incredibly grand promises about both, he\\'s also delivered extremely well.\\n\\nIt\\'s like someone suggesting they\\'d pay you $500k for being a janitor at their place... and then paying $250k. I mean, a little short, but compared to the alternatives, holy shit. , Don\\'t forget the Electric SemiTrucks that would need to carry air since the weight of the batteries would exceed the structural support weight of most bridges. , Cringe , So you think you\\'re a more qualified engineer than him is what you\\'re saying\\n\\nYou just hate him because he asked a few questions commonly posed by conservatives. You were basically manipulated into hating him because he didn\\'t shut up a tow the line like a good famous person , The hyper loop was an idea he posted about but said at the time he was too busy to go after, so it has all been outside private industry working on it. \\n\\nThey built a test track to host competitions from others, but have been busy with cars and rockets and side tracked with tunnels over spending real effort on the loop. , There r real reasons to dislike u and fhen there r people like u. U clearly read elon bad online and are parotting it. , Where did he say that he was going to build Hyperloop by 2021? , THAT is what makes him a conman in your opinion? , 😂 Can\\'t wait to watch them defend it , When you get anything impactful done to help the world maybe your critiques will carry weight. , >When he introduced hyperloop he literally said they don’t have time to dedicate to make it but that someone should and wrote a long paper on their vision for how it’s possible. They went above and beyond that by building a test track for students to test. \\n\\nBullshit. He specifically said it will be open by 2021 to get money from investors (which he got $400,000,000 of) - conman behaviour. Easy call. \\n\\n>The LV loop exists but is in its early release to public rides. I want to see what it’s full operational throughput is before I judge their first tunnel iteration.\\n\\nThat\\'s just cope. You can track it\\'s development from his big vision being downgraded into what it is now because he told big lies about how much it will cost/how fast it will be to raise money without any care for how realistic that it. - again, pure conman behaviour. \\n\\n>The solar tile being accused of being vaporware amuses me since I’m sitting in a house next door to a home with one as we speak. Those neighbors love it and it looks unlike any other roof on the market.\\n\\nCool, doesn\\'t change the fact that it was unambiguously a massive scam. \\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/mansionengineer.com/2019/02/04/elon-musk-tesla-and-the-solar-roof-tile-fraud-update/amp/ , Oh, you\\'ve been riding the Hyperloop, have you? What\\'s it like? , You got ripped off. Well done. , > So\\n\\nThis is how you know it\\'s going to be a good response. , No, I expect the starlink tech is pretty good. \\n\\nBut people driving cars which have a habit of spontaneously combusting and have had over 500,000 recalls are dummies, yes. , No, they are heavily subsidized ventures. , Yeah Tesla is making money bit people are quickly catching on to the cars being a ripoff as seen by dropping sales to other companies and staggering numbers of recalls. \\n\\nSpacex is literally about to go bankrupt. Google it. \\n\\nAnd the recent batch of starlink satellites have been knocked out due to poor engineering. \\n\\nAnd these are literally the best examples of what musk took credit for. \\n\\nCalling him a conman is easier than calling putin a fascist. , And? Victims of fraud don\\'t have to give fraudsters money if they don\\'t want to. \\n\\nThat doesn\\'t change the fact that conmen are conmen. , And almost all modern startups are complete scams just like juicero. \\n\\nWhat a coincidence. , Musk had literally nothing to do with the creation of PayPal. Look it up. \\n\\nHe was appointed CEO after it\\'s creation and he was fired from that role shortly after. \\n\\nJust because you don\\'t like what I\\'m saying doesn\\'t make me a troll. \\n\\nMusk is a cunt, you don\\'t have to defend him. , Well, it\\'s different if you\\'re selling it to people, even as a \"beta\".  And you\\'re speaking to someone who is published in their scientific field. , Wow, he didn\\'t lie about a publicity stunt. What a visionary. \\n\\nNah, it\\'s not unrealistic to expect people like him to keep his promises when it comes to products they announce. \\n\\nPeople with integrity, such as steve jobs did exactly that. \\n\\nYour bar is just very low for some reason. Be better. \\n\\nHe has had far more failures and blatant scams than successes. Simple as. , I already told you you\\'re wrong about that in your previous comment. , Where did I ever say they were better? \\n\\nAnd you have the audacity to call me a troll , Oh shiiiiit that is awesome then! , If Russians captured a Starlink receiver, they could use it , Minus the fact they are planning to test cobalt-free batteries in Chinese Model 3s (pending government approval) and eventually roll them out to the rest of the world. , It’s pretty lucky then that the technology required to fulfil that dream will massively benefit mankind. , Respectfully disagree. That may (and probably would) invoke a NATO response. The company is too important to the US. , Thank you, I had no idea how it operates as apparently it wasn’t around earlier and I thought it was just a wi-fi hotspot transmitted from a satellite across the country, and it was ready to connect as the topic says “high-speed Internet now available”. The horrible thing to happen now would be left without a 4g or wired if anything happens to either. , It\\'s not his success and wealth. It\\'s that he\\'s a fucking cunt. Thanks for putting words in my mouth though. , You literally just said the same fucking thing as me then acted like it\\'s somehow more relevent? It doesn\\'t matter what kind of beam it uses, it\\'s a microwave link, a low powered one, and can easily be jammed. , Just to clarify, starlink is a novel application of phased arrays for satellite communication.  Phased arrays are not even remotely a new thing though. , Considering that the starlink dishes just arrived, they haven\\'t needed to jam them yet. It\\'s probably more of a case of indifference than anything.  They don\\'t need to knock out all internet access nor have they managed to do so as evidenced by the large number of Ukrainian webcams and social media users still active.  It\\'s a nice gesture and a diverse array of access methods certainly irks the Russians.  My point wasn\\'t that it isn\\'t helpful, but it isn\\'t the impenetrable savior that people in this thread are touting it as. , Phased arrays aren\\'t immune to strong off axis signals though. They are much less sensitive to off axis signals , but if you\\'re drowning out user signals by 1000 watts it doesnt matter. And I\\'d bet the satellites themselves arent using phased arrays, but rather a dish because the satellite doesn\\'t need to redirect it\\'s beam. , Is it attacking if it doesn\\'t actually damage anything? An analogy might be that Ukraine and the US are in a room talking, then Russia comes in and starts screaming so loud that nobody can hear anything except for Russia\\'s screaming.  The UN has regulatory agreements regarding global radio spectrum usage, and Russia would certainly be breaking those rules, but I highly doubt that jamming Musk\\'s private internet constellation would be the straw to break the camel\\'s back.\\n\\nEdit: Oops I was responding to the person you were addressing.  I leave it and direct them here. , lol this is such an amazing response , Thanks :) , Damn, I didn’t know that. Good info sir. , He would have saved money by buying rockets instead of building them. Remember SpaceX was 1 failed launch from going out of business.\\n\\nSpaceX has done nothing but lose money, that\\'s what it does. It\\'s his hobby, not a business.\\n\\nHe makes money off carbon offset credits and nothing more. If they go away Tesla loses over half it\\'s value. Tesla would have died in 2008 without a government loan. , I\\'ve never liked him; but I am not fan of billionaires in general. I don\\'t think people can accumulate that much wealth without doing some pretty dodgy shit. I don\\'t think he is supervillian evil like Bezos, I just think he is a bit of an asshole , i generally just don\\'t simp for billionaires. I\\'m also Australian, so I don\\'t really buy into your democrat/republican stuff. I mean - I generally do my own research (I admit I didn\\'t look into the emerald mine as much).

My only issue is with Elon worship.\\n\\nFrom what I understand, these terminals will be useful if Russia cuts a main undersea cable, disconnecting Ukraine from the rest of the world while leaving city/town terminals intact? Ukraine would still be able to communicate with each other, just not the outside world (through the internet anyway).\\n\\nIs it feasible to start destroying major connecting hubs to heavily limit meshes and are these little dishes capable of receiving and sending tens of thousands of requests? , That\\'s not entirely accurate.  In 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, the ISS partnership 100% relied on Russian Soyuz rockets to get crew to and from the station.  When sanctions were imposed, Rogozin(Head of Roscosmos) infamously tweeted \"If the US didn\\'t like Russia\\'s policies and was going to persist in economic sanctions perhaps they would like to use a trampoline to get to space?\"\\n\\nIn 2020, after transporting Bob and Doug to the ISS for the first time, Musk quipped in a NASA press conference that [the trampoline is working](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/the-trampoline-is-working-spacex-returns-human-spaceflight-to-america/). , https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/1v6n6c/elons\\\\_insane\\\\_experiences\\\\_buying\\\\_refurbished\\\\_icbms/ , The probably didn’t have one to sell. All that old military and space gear is worth great money on the scrap market. \\n\\nLook at Putin’s army, it’s in shambles. Old equipment running out of fuel and those poor conscripts are having to choke down 7 year expired MREs. Ha ha. Russia is broke, Putin and his cronies robbed the motherland blind. \\n\\nSlava Ukraini! , Important to note they were old rockets that almost certainly weren’t worth 21 million lol. Plus they scammed him out of $5000 just to move forward with negotiations. , Capitalistic socialism always works bby!!\\n\\nFtfy. Elon managed his feat thanks to govt subsidies. Not to take away from his accomplishment becasue the incentive from USgovt has always been there. It\\'s just no one else had the resource let alone the balls or vision to take on the endevour. I hate on Musk a lot but the guy has done good for progress. Much more than I have so far , For the Americans. The Russians seem to have lost a fucking lot since they went capitalists. , Nothing in this story has key components of capitalism. What are you trying to say? , No it the fuck does not. , No, not always, but it does behind the hands of someone who wants to make something, do something, not just suck resources from people. , capitalist fascism always beats crony fascism , Thanks. I\\'ll go check into that. , And what does this say about you, the way you are behaving here?\\n\\nLuckily, you are not a billionarire, or you would probably be paying people to be in your personal army, which you would use to kill tons of people. , Better than hating on people for being successful 🙄 , Huh? Pointing out how despicably someone is behaving is \"simping for billionaires\"?\\n\\nWow. , Yes. , It should be very useful.\\n\\nThere is one major limitation right now though... distance.\\n\\nThe newer Starlink satellites that have been launched have satellite to satellite lasers, which can transmit information from one point on earth, to any others. The problem is, they are very, very far away from having this full system running.\\n\\nThe shells they have up right now can only receive information from a dish, and then send it down to a base station. Due to the curvature of the Earth, this sight line is somewhere around 600 km (I could be a bit off on that). \\n\\nNow, someone mentioned that they believe SpaceX can have the dishes work as a mesh network. If so, you could get a network pretty much anywhere in Ukraine that you want.... , USA mil just announced they’re building their own version so pretty sure LEO internet is going to be integral to connected warfare and homeland command and control going forward. , The thing I was trying to get at with my question of directionality is if the satellites only look in a certain direction for incoming signals from the ground, or if they effectively are \"listening\" omnidirectionally.  I know when either the satellite or ground terminal is sending a signal out it is directional, using EM interference to steer the signal beam and concentrate the outgoing energy in a particular direction, to get a stronger signal at the targeted location.\\n\\nBut it isn\\'t clear to me if the receive end is also directional, and if it is, how that would work since I don\\'t think there is some sort of reverse analog to the process of constructive interference used to create the outgoing directional beam.  If the satellite listened in all directions, it would still hear the directed signal from the user terminal, and it would use things like specific frequency bands to filter out any other random noise it picks up (unless that noise was very loud and broad spectrum, like a jammer).\\n\\nSo I was speculating that if the listening end of things is not directional, it would make it easier to jam because the jamming antenna wouldn\\'t need to be in a specific location in between the ground terminal and satellite.  As long as the receiving antenna could pick up the jamming signal from somewhere in its field of view, if it is overwhelmingly stronger than the Starlink transmit signal (which would be easy to do as the signals from the ground terminals and satellites are both relatively weak), I\\'d think it could be jammed.\\n\\nBut, I am not an RF or antenna expert so I may well be missing something here. , SpaceX can launch them faster than they get shot down. And they orbit so low that debris isn\\'t aajor concern. , He\\'s the Kanye of business , Finally some fucking nuance , Pretty much. Strongly dislike the dude but he can do some *wonderful* things when he wants to. , There was a game, there was a man   \\n\\n And we could call him Ted Faro , [lol so, that\\'s called fraud, and you should stop normalizing it.](https://www.businessinsider.com/theranos-founder-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-life-story-bio-2018-4)\\n\\nimo of all the things to stop normalizing, fraud should be chief among them. , So what you\\'re saying is that the problem is, is that we\\'ve developed a society where narcissism and sociopathy are actually required traits in order to advance.\\n\\nAm I getting that right? , He made it up , That documentary made me realise how fucking scary the situation was. , All that aside, I lost any respect or tolerance for Elon the moment I learned his parents owned an emerald mine in apartheid SA. Maybe it\\'s not his fault, but if you benefit from the death and suffering of others without doing something to change it, you\\'re a piece of shit in my book. Daddy\\'s money has taken him far, it\\'s up to us to make sure that\\'s as far as he goes , Strange how it was the actual rescue team that requested the sub, and sent the specifications. , Some psycho shit , >\\tThe logic is if Diver knows Elon did it for clout, then Elon knows Diver goes to Thailand for children.\\n\\n???\\n\\nThat “logic” makes no sense. That “if… then…” statement has absolutely no apparent connection between the two. Can you explain what the hell you’re trying to say here? , yes we know they wouldn\\'t have worked, some of the parts of the cave (especially between certain chambers) barely fit the divers and sedated kids.\\n\\nElon got butt hurt and tried to be an edgelord.\\n\\nAnd the driver he was talking about was a dude that was living in Thailand and exploring that very cave for 5+ years. , The subs *may* have been able to get to the kids, but it’s not very feasible to imagine how they would have gotten the kids out. The spaces were tight, the kids would panick, the journey took hours. They really needed an experienced, calm human to be there helping those kids out. Expecting them to make it on their own with a remote sub is unrealistic. , We should just speak and judge fairly, both good and bad stuff.\\n\\nDelivering starlink hardware to Ukraine is great.\\n\\nI think sub was decent idea coming from good place. Plus he provided other supplies, mobile power, etc to help with the rescue.\\n\\nWhat he said about the diver wasn\\'t nice, but it was just insult.\\n\\nNow the fact that he undermined significance of covid or supported right-wing trucker extremists... that\\'s super fucked up. , Imagine simping for a billionaire who doesn’t give a shit about you , The edit but not ironically , Elon Musk is objectively bad and you’re giving him too much credit. , >\\tYes yes Elon shouldn’t have called him that, but eh we are all humans and we make mistakes.\\n\\n\\nToday I knicked myself while cutting onions. That’s a human mistake. I’ve never accidentally accused someone of being a pedophile. When you have a platform of literally millions, that’s not a whoopsie daisy, that’s a choice that Elon made to change his life. , This is accurate. I remember reading up on it in detail. Diver was a nobody, not on the rescue team. \\n\\nFurthermore, Elon apologized. Because Elon himself got scammed by a guy saying he was a private investigator. This “investigator” was the one that found evidence of the diver being a pedo. Elon ran with it. Turns out, not true and Elon said he was embarrassed. , I don’t think the rescue diver lived in Thailand? , Nope, that’s just you champ , Imagine saving children from literal death and then a billionaire and his fans call you a pedo because you took the limelight away from him. , He was there for the rescue operation. Now we all have the same opinion of you, which is to say “dunce”. , How do you delete someone else\\'s comment? , The one about threats of suicide. , And it was world famous billionaire Elon Musk that called the nobody volunteer cave diver a pedophile on his twitter to millions of people. , Joke\\'s on them he\\'s into that 🤣\\n\\nSpank me harder Mr SEC man, I\\'ve been such a bad boy misleading the market. , Yeah if someone said something like that i can understand Elon\\'s frustration, but there\\'s a line between that and slander. \\n\\nIf I remember the diver sued him over it? I didn\\'t really care about the drama, since it seemed like the real news was how hard it was to rescue the kids. , I wrote the gist of what I remembered on the go.\\n\\n  At the time (was a few years ago) the real news seemed to be the kids being stuck in the cave. The whole he said, they said situation seemed as substantial as Kanye\\'s KimK screenshots the other week.\\n\\n If I remember correctly there was also some sort of lawsuit but like I said I just can\\'t be bothered to look that up. \\n\\nThanks for the info. , [According to this](https://thethaiger.com/news/bangkok/the-isan-project-honours-a-hero-of-tham-luang-cave-rescue), that \"hobby cave mapper\" was the first diver on scene, conducted dangerous reconnaissance dives and was also the person who got Thai authorities in touch with the Brits on the \"real rescue team\" as he had those contacts in the cave-diving community. He was so crucial to the effort he was one of three divers later awarded an MBE. Obviously he didn\\'t participate in the actual rescue dive - he was in his 60s - but that doesn\\'t mean he wasn\\'t part of the \"official\" team, he clearly was. , Yes, Dragon has a crew capacity of 7, but the current Dragon capsules only have four seats installed. It would be a rough ride down without a seat to sit in. , Crew Dragon requires SpaceX suits, so even if they had extra seats they would need the suits.\\n\\nCrew Dragon can likely to a fully automated launch/dock like cargo Dragon. So they could empty life boat launch of Crew Dragon. , **Anecdotally**, the cosmonauts sent to NASA [during a visit](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/50-years-ago-cosmonauts-visit-united-states/) were ordered to spy, and everybody knew it. NASA officials \"accidentally\" exposed some outdated secret materials that the cosmonauts could send back. Not quite as overt as, \"Oh, this is a folder of stuff you\\'re not supposed to see, just a moment while I go get some coffee,\" but pretty close. The cosmonauts knew that the info was outdated, but it was good enough to send that they could claim they spied. They didn\\'t get into trouble, NASA didn\\'t lose secrets, cosmonauts and astronauts got to hang out, everybody was happy. , Problem is that the ISS maneuverability, the small rocket motors in the side to turn it around or move it or down a bit in the orbit are all in the Russian part. So if some Russian general or the current lunatic Russian ISS manager decides to run the ISS into US or European soil, as he announced recently, nobody but SpaceX could help them.\\n\\nThe Russians could start the death sequence, move to their escape hatches and leave. The rest would be doomed to wait for the next Falcon flying by. , I suspect Elon could build something quickly, but I don\\'t think they have anything ready to go right now that could do the stationkeeping duties. , Total seats yes, but SpaceX only has one Crew Dragon up there for 4 astronauts. The rest of the astronauts and cosmonauts came up on Soyuz. It may not be safe for them to go back down on Soyuz, due to Russia running it. Not saying they are going to blow up the Soyuz or the station. It\\'s the risk once they are on land. , Yeah the guy has some really shitty business ethics and definitely is in it to make money.  BUT, he gets alot of the big stuff right. (Excluding of course his COVID response to masks, vaxx, etc) , Well, yes and no.  SpaceX rocket launches were being funded long before getting those contracts.  Read up on the history of SpaceX. , A far reaching vision of rich humankind in space, whilst we are left here to rot, no doubt. , Initially yes, but with Starlink and commercial flights the whole thing likely becomes self sustainable pretty soon and NASA and USAF will of course reap the benefits as well. Any investment they made will be easily earned back by the sheer amount of cost shavings from launching stuff into space. , What\\'s with all the sexual references?  You people are just plain fucked up. , Reminder:  you\\'re in r/ukraine.   Why are you in r/ukraine, if not to support Ukraine? , Yes. But your comparison assumes nasa technology locks themselves? In an alternate time line where we threw money at NASA instead of defunding why would those same engineers who developed the technology at SpaceX who would then probably work for NASA develop the same tech at NASA? , That’s why private insurance is.... less efficient? , The one they developed with the current timelines funding? Still not seeing a good comparison. , It\\'s bc NASA subcontracts every damn thing, and contractors are fucking amazingly efficient at wasting govt money , This is literally a right wing starve the beast talking point.. pretending that spacex also doesn’t have a massive bureaucracy that wastes money is incredibly naive. , you\\'re wrong, u/teamsaxon is right this minute finishing up his own Sat constellation so he can provide the struggling nation of Ukraine free internet as well! either that or licking cheeto dust off his fingers and putting hotpockets in the microwave for dinner. , If I was a billionaire I would be donating much more than I currently can afford to donate. Rich people don\\'t get rich by donating to the poor. He will write it off in his taxes, so he can make even more money to sit on. , Keep throatin\\', Daddy Elon will notice your reddit history soon enough. , oh funny! yes, its about helping ukraine, sure, thats what you say after you accuse someone of pedophilia to defend musk in the coments :D sure, you have no other motives  \\n\\n\\nso all in all  \\n\\n\\nFuck elon musk, he is not a good person, its amazing he send this to ukraine, but that does not make him even close to a good person, getting over the bar thats on the literal floor for being a... human.. does not mean he is a good person , Referring to yourself in the third person is rather fashionable. , It\\'s \\'could have\\', never \\'could of\\'.\\n\\nRejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot! , Agreed. It\\'s a struggle for all of us humans to avoid black and white thinking when dug in or stressed. Elon\\'s shit mirror neurons are a fight for another day. , Reddit is definitely a hivemind, though very schizophrenic. You have to look at it not from the comments but which of the comments get upvoted; by design only a few ideas make it to the top. It\\'s actually quite similar to how human brains work. We have a little thinking loop that processes many thoughts in parallel but most get pruned and merged into a few ideas that make it to the conscious side. , Just like how in a human mind, there are different brain networks that often come into conflict. , Like fucking hell there isn\\'t. , Nah it\\'s being a soy fueled hivemind , Constantly changing your mind about a billionaire is not independent thought. It’s actually the opposite. , You might not think of Fukushima or Chernobyl when you think of sunflowers, but they naturally decontaminate soil. They can soak up hazardous materials such as uranium, lead, and even arsenic! So next time you have a natural disaster … Sunflowers are the answer! , There really is, you’ve been on here 8 years cmon man you know damn well Reddit is very biased and collectively leans towards certain ideals.\\n\\nJust look at the front page on an average day. If you say anything controversial with regards to politics, religion, culture, etc, you get downvoted to oblivion if not banned. , Agreed. It doesn’t matter how many good deeds he does, he’s a terrible person, as is every other billionaire in America. , Who cares if he’s a cunt if his companies are innovating and helping in so many ways. , The hate didn\\'t start until they saw how rich he was , Just recently became richest person in the world and certainly shows it, but I think this trend is more recent. Like the 2020 primaries is when it came to dominate , Which coup? Were they over throwing a dictator , In my opinion the hate boner is because there is a lot of money going into anti-Tesla propaganda from the fossil fuel industry and non-electric vehicle companies. So these redditors have actually bought into propaganda. The simple fact is reddit should love Elon - he\\'s an industry disruptor, leading the renewable revolution, and is mildly autistic. , Nope, there were lots of anonymous comments and leaks from Russian businessman and generals reported on before this all began , Don\\'t really care about the argument but I have to say your butt is really pretty. , \"Mr Musk apologised on Twitter and in court for his outburst.\"\\n\\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50695593\\n\\nI think you owe Elon an apology. Lol. , > You’d call a dude who rescued kids a pedo because you were called narcissistic? I feel like the response isn’t proportional and you’re trying (and failing) to downplay it. It was fucked up. It showed that he was an egotistical prick. Calling him a whiny baby and bringing up the autism spectrum just diminishes the level of responsibility this grown ass billionaire has over his actions.\\n\\nHow much responsibility does someone have to take before the twitter and reddit mobs are satisfied?\\n\\nYou know how much it is? He\\'d have to rake his entrails out with a rusty screwdriver before your bloodthirst would be satisfied.\\n\\nYou\\'re making the world a more hostile place when you\\'re so critical of specific incidents, and then act like you\\'ve never done anything questionable. , Um, I am not saying it was the right thing, but I understand the anger and frustration.\\n\\nIf you find yourself unable to empathize with people who are different than yourself, you might be the narcissist yourself. , Being mad because someone insulted you attempt at aid is narcissistic? Imo thats pretty a reasonable reaction.\\n\\nAnd while pinning stuff on a person\\'s condition may be shitty, in my opinion its worth noting the condition is there. , You\\'re a narcissist hijacking a thread about support for Ukraine with your Tesla/Musk hate.  GTFO. , I’m somewhat narcissistic ngl. I think I’m cool. 😎 , You definitely lost some money shorting Tesla to be this dedicated to writing all this garbage on here. , > Is using slave labor in African emerald mines understandable too?\\n\\nHe did not do that.\\n\\nThat is hyperbole.\\n\\n> How about working your employees to death and paying them low wages and treating them worse than Amazon warehouse workers?\\n\\nUnlike Amazon, if you work for SpaceX or Tesla for a couple years, anyone else will hire you on the spot. I\\'m not saying it\\'s great or that he\\'s perfect; I think he could stand to be easier on his employees.\\n\\nHowever, they do choose to work there, and it\\'s already competitive to get into SpaceX and Tesla. , Ah yes, his father owning shares in a Zambian emerald mine that went belly-up is the same as Elon profiteering off of slave labor. , Make Tesla into the first successful electric car company, instead of working on something that was much more likely to be successful. , \"If you don\\'t hate him, you\\'re a bootlicker.\"\\n\\n-You , Your own source states it\\'s an allegation, do you have a different source that states otherwise? , Nope, wrong doings shouldn\\'t be hidden despite the place. Unless you would also like to do the same with Russia. You also brought it up in the first place. , I will do that as soon as you stop sucking his dick. , I mean or we can accept that human people are complex and can do bad things AND good things. Elon has done plenty of the bad things we can’t deny that but also this is absolutely phenomenal no doubt , Fuck off loser , \"So and so called so and so a poopy head, he is now persona non grata.\" , Except, when you\\'re a billionaire your oopsies and immaturity harms the little people your business empire towers over. Elon, Zucc, and the gang have a social responsibility to be behave themselves in public, treat their workers right and cooperate with governments (aka pay their taxes), or else that\\'s a very good argument that billionaires shouldn\\'t exist. , Yep, he has put just about everything on the line for these companies that he obviously cares a lot about, and are proving to be great for humanity.  I don\\'t care much for the guy and I think he\\'s quite a narcissist but it he\\'s doing it so he can be known as the guy who helped us transition to renewable energy and became a multiplanet species I\\'ll deal with his immature outbursts and such. , It\\'s literally how his family got wealthy.\\n\\nHe inherited the mine from his parents.\\n\\nThen he bought Paypal and Tesla, which he didn\\'t found or invent. Then he ousted the founders and installed himself as President and now people say he \"founded\" Paypal and Tesla, despite the fact he actually just bought himself a seat. , I\\'m afraid... Elon was already rich by the time Tesla stock hit the market.. , Wrong.\\n\\nhttps://savingjournalism.substack.com/p/i-talked-to-elon-musk-about-journalism?utm_source=url , So which great idea of yours is benefitting war-torn Ukraine right now? As far as I can see Elon is delivering Internet, from fucking SPACE. stfu... , As im reading through this comments section, which i\\'ll admit isnt really the best source, pretty much the unanimous agreement seems to be that the *best* part about elon is the ideas he has. There are arguments about his moral compass and him as a person but nobody denies that what he\\'s done technologically is pretty great. , >If I buy a bunch of lottery tickets and win, am I a sane investor or just lucky?  \\n>  \\n>Also, it\\'s not likely for tsla to stay so high forever unless you think they\\'re going to be the only auto manufacturer in existence.\\n\\nu/bastian74 still thinks he understands how to value Tesla better than Tesla bulls.\\n\\nYou don\\'t kid.\\n\\n!RemindMe 2 years , If you think about it, all his projects are for mars. Hyperloop, EV\\'s, rockets, starlink, tunnels, robots, they will all be used on mars. , Also the boring company has significantly reduced the cost and increased the speed of digging tunnels. That\\'s the main goal. After that you can make anything you want in them. Roads, trains, etc. , > it’s mainly prep for his mars colony…\\n\\nDude if you believe any part of that has a chance in hell of actually happening, you have your whole head in the Kool-Aid bowl. Terraforming/colonizing Mars is a patently absurd idea. Musk promises fantastical achievements without any proof that they are achievable bc his followers/tech journalists will accept it uncritically and he can finesse money from investors whose returns depend on a cycle of hype.\\n\\nMars colonies will never happen. Tesla FSD will never happen. The hyperloop never happened and underground tunnels don’t actually solve an extent problem. , He is a well known snake oil salesman… plenty of actual scientists have debunked him countless times. Many make videos about it, you should go watch them. The hyperloop isn’t his idea, it’s very old, and has been shown to not be feasible. Someone else in the 90’s created the tech to launch a rocket and then land it, they actually have the video. Boring was an absolute joke, he created nothing and built equipment way smaller than what is actually used to dig tunnels. He then lied saying it would be cheaper to use his garbage… this can go on and on. , Reeeeee I hate it when people spend their money to try to invent useful things. Reeeeeeee he should just bought a new yacht , You do realise the first semis have been driving around the US for ~2 years now, and the first deliveries took place in January and were working as promised? , source? , Simple physics and math says you are wrong. Do the calculations and see for yourself , Wow, that\\'s some hard hitting stuff right there. , > So you think you\\'re a more qualified engineer than him is what you\\'re saying\\n\\nThe ineptitude of this statement, the many wrong things you\\'d have to be assuming to even think it. Holy shit, little buddy, how do you walk and breath at the same time? How could someone like you even type shit out?\\n\\nWell good luck out there, btw, do you happen to know where Elon got his engineering degree? Oh, shit, I forgot, he\\'s not an engineer by education, just by declaration of the company he owns. Weird. , That didn\\'t stop him publically announcing \"it\\'s real, it\\'s gonna happen, give me money to make it happen!\"\\n\\nYou know, conman behaviour. , Who fucking types like this? Are you in middle school? , Hyperloop is dumb, hence it dying away in lieu of actual innovation. , Tell that to musk\\'s lithium mining child slaves. , Everything starts off as a \\'scam\\', until it isn\\'t. People said the same things about Teslas cars, landing rockets etc. He\\'s an engineer, all these things will be solved given enough engineering. , You can\\'t link a source to your claim that he promised a hyperloop in 2021. Where would that even be?\\n\\nYou are wrong and should feel bad for spreading lies , Idiot , How so, does more now than when I bought it, its been fantastic , Nono, when you quote a single word in their comment as the basis for your response, now *that\\'s* a good response. , Hahahahaha wtf. Tesla\\'s have 10x less chance of catching fire than ICE cars even including accidents and they don\\'t spontaneously combust. That\\'s just the Chevvy Bolt. , The cars spontaneously combusts less often then the average car does. , > But people driving cars which have a habit of spontaneously combusting\\n\\nBecause ICE cars would never do that... The difference is, that there is usually not news articles being published every time there is a ICE car fire. Why? Because they happen so often, it would drown out anything else.\\n\\n> and have had over 500,000 recalls\\n\\nI hear this one again and again. Everyone seems to not know how frequently every car manufacturer have to recall their cars. It seems to me like you and many others only care about it when it\\'s Tesla because Elon bad.\\n\\nHere are some of the big recalls in the EU from only the last 30 days:\\n\\n[[28/01/2022] Jeep. Affected models: Grand Cherokee, Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer. Vehicle numbers (worldwide): 103,890](https://car-recalls.eu/recall/jeep-grand-cherokee-2021-airbags/)\\n\\n[[25/02/2022] Opel. Affected models: Insignia. Vehicle numbers (worldwide): 571,942](https://car-recalls.eu/recall/opel-insignia-2007-rear-track-rods/)\\n\\n[[18/02/2022] Dodge. Affected models: RAM. Vehicle numbers (worldwide): 499,228](https://car-recalls.eu/recall/ram-1500-2021-wheel-bolts/)\\n\\n[[11/02/2022] Mazda. Affected models: Mazda 5 (CR) vehicles fitted with a passenger airbag deactivation switch. Vehicle numbers (worldwide): 160,519](https://car-recalls.eu/recall/mazda-5-2010-airbag-deactivation-switch/)\\n\\nAnd nobody fucking cares about it because it isn\\'t Tesla. This is what\\'s happening with Tesla cars catching fire. Every now and again a new Tesla catches fire and the media goes wild every time. Even though there are about 150 car fires in the US daily, you don\\'t hear anything about them. They happen so often that they are boring and nobody wants to read articles about it. , Hahahahahahaha , Everybody I know who has a Tesla wants another one. Including me. The recalls you mention are with almost every brand and consisist of changing a wire in some vehicles. I love our Tesla its the best thing we ever bought.  \\n  \\nSpaceX is not going bankrupt its very healthy financially. Elon Musk stated that if they didn\\'t fix their engine problems with raptor 2 they could go bankrupt if they followed the planned schedule because they wouldn\\'t be able to launch starship twice a week. But raptor 2 is finished and ready.  And starship as well.\\n  \\nStarlink sattelites burned up after launch because of a thicker athmosphere created by solar flares that increased drag and prevented the sattelites to reach their required altitude. Unfortunate but 38 lost out of 1970 active satelites is not to bad. Now they launch them a bit higher out of precaution.  \\n  \\nYou should google. In any case Elon Musk is weird often says strange things but his products work and are in fact the only vehicle capable of launch people in space that is not owned by Russia or China.  \\n  \\nI am very glad he decided to help Ukraine with one of the most powerfull tools in the world.: Unrestricted and fast acces to the internet.   \\n  \\nLet Ukraine make the most of it! , Life must be hard going on the internet to incessantly bitch about someone who will never know you exist , Troll\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nСлава Героям України!    Glory to the heroes of Ukraine! , Musk and his brother started Zip2. Later they sold it for millions. Musk used that money to start X.com. It later merged with Confinity and the new company was X.com. Musk was the largest shareholder and CEO of the company. One of their products was PayPal. He was eventually forced out of X.com which rebranded to PayPal. When PayPal sold to EBay Musk was still the largest shareholder and made about $170 million. He used that money to start SpaceX and Tesla. Yes he did help start Tesla. He was employee #4 and contributed most of their initial funding. , How is it different when self driving is already a product which thousands of users make use of on the road in their Teslas?\\n\\nIt\\'s an optional product with T&Cs. Like a conditional preorder. Absolutely no con about it. The beta has known capabilities and users buy it with those capabilities in mind.\\n\\nAnyway, the James Webb example should be enough to convince you that\\'s not how science works. The Webb telescope had approximate completion dates. No scientist or politician in the world thinks the people working on the project, who proposed it, are conmen for completing their incredibly difficult, humanity serving goal late , HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA , >People with integrity, such as steve jobs did exactly that. \\n\\nOof. You lost this one buddy lmao , Go away, Troll  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nСлава Героям України!    Glory to the heroes of Ukraine! , You completely missed my point, Troll !!!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nСлава Героям України!    Glory to the heroes of Ukraine! , Yeah, but the issue is that Russia is trying to snuff out Ukraines communications thereby making it harder for them to coordinate counterattacks. Russia already has the necessary equipment to communicate so one more point of access won’t help them as much. , That would be a nice source of intel for the US. , I\\'m sure some of it will help to some degree.  Massively benefit mankind I\\'m not so sure about.  \\n\\nThere really isn\\'t any point in sending people to Mars.  There is nothing there for us, it\\'s basically like setting up a colony on the ocean floor.  Sure, we could do it, and it would be cool, and maybe a few of the technologies and logistics we come up with could be innovative, but in the end the billions used could have gone to better things than someone\\'s egotistical dream. , I don\\'t think you understood what I meant. Think 99 luftballons but with a Starship. , I\\'m sorry for the misunderstanding.  I also have two friends in Ukraine right now, so I am also concerned about them if the 4G becomes non-operational.  Best wishes to you and to all of Ukraine! , >  I thought it was just a wi-fi hotspot transmitted from a satellite across the country\\n\\nYou weren\\'t too far off. It is transmitted from the satellite across the country but the wifi hotspots themselves are generated by these terminals on the ground which relay through the satellites. , You don’t seem to know how directional radio works do you? It absolutely matters what kind of beam and what antenna your using. An omnidirectional antenna with no beamforming is much easier to scramble because you’re using the transmitter’s power to broadcast in every direction. That’s why your wifi at home only covers the area around your house. However, a directed beam with something like a parabolic antenna goes much further and is extremely unlikely to jam without specifically targeting it, or being in between the receiver than the transmitter. The same amount of power that would connect devices 100 meters on an omnidirectional antenna would easily go 20 miles on a parabolic antenna. Starlink terminals don’t have to be powerful if the beam is directed well. On top of that, there’s not one receiver but a whole constellation of moving satellites. I’m not at all stating that they can’t be jammed, but to suggest that it will be as trivial as you imply is extremely arguable. , No they didn’t , Oh no certainly not suggesting that!\\n\\nAs for military use the first test was with the usaf... , So I’m confused about something. With the obvious extremely divergent narration by Putin, their representative, and media censorship in their state, why have they not yet jammed all satellites in said area? Something seems amis. , Starlink satellites use both. Parabolic dishes direct a small number of high bandwidth beams to the gateways (which connect to the traditional internet), while phased arrays on each sat direct a large number of low bandwidth beams to individual users.\\n\\nYou are correct about the off-axis jamming, but it’s still really complicated. The further off axis they are located, the higher the transmit power required. And these satellites are quickly moving targets that must be actively tracked. Does Russia have a large number of mobile units with this capability? , > He would have saved money by buying rockets instead of building them. Remember SpaceX was 1 failed launch from going out of business.\\n\\nNo he wouldn\\'t. He only had enough money from his sale of PayPal to maybe buy 1 or 2 rockets from Russia with no potential for profit. \\nSpaceX on the other hand has billions in revenue and investment. If by \"lose money\" you mean they spend more on R&D than their income, then you\\'re right - except that\\'s exactly why they\\'ve grown so fast. , Ford and GM also would have died in 2008 without a government loan.\\n\\nWait, Ford hasn\\'t paid it back, and GM did go bankrupt, all while Tesla paid it back early, and paid extra because of it.\\n\\nGuess that doesn\\'t fit your narrative though... , I don\\'t know that I agree. JK Rowling wrote some books about young wizards and made $1 billion off of that. Good for her I say. , are you sure there\\'s not a place in between simping for billionaires and believing every lie told to you about him that makes you angry? Like maybe acknowledging that you\\'ve done little to no research on his life from credible sources? Or maybe just being generally emotionally healthy and at least appreciating that he made EVs commercially viable and that\\'s good for the planet? , “Gray! The world is gray, Jack!” , My mind can not comprehend a B in subtlety. It messes me up every time I see it. , YES. NO ONE IS GREY. WE ARE ALL BLACK AND WHITE. EITHERYOU ARE WITH ME OR AGAINST ME. , Ppl demand a Jesus character in everything.  “Did u know Einstein was a terrible father?  Did you know The Beach Boys had a gangbang with a girl on the beach once?  Did you know Van Gogh was a psycho and cut off his ear?”\\n\\nYes, everyone knows those things.  They also discovered relativity, made some great music, and innovated painting.  That’s what we remember them for.  The rest of their lives were a mess. We don’t need them be perfect gods to appreciate their best work, bc you’re not supposed to worship them and emulate them.  And it really is only their best work we’re mostly interested in.  Most of the songs and early paintings were crap, and Einstein wasted years of his life on a fools errand. , And he followed through here and SpaceX is achieving amazing things. , Presumably Part 1 was [Airplane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Cpc8Vw-2A)? , Because the war in Ukraine is like 3 days old , Elon intentionally hurts people. , Incorrect https://savingjournalism.substack.com/p/i-talked-to-elon-musk-about-journalism?utm_source=url , People can be good and evil, hate him for the bad stuff, don\\'t invalidate the good stuff. , While I am a native English speaker, I never knew that \"trading an airplane for half ownership of a mine\" is considered \"stealing\".  Also I learned that children are completely responsible for everything their parents do.  Also, that IronRaptor knows the intents and thoughts and motivations of people with whom he has never spent one iota of time.\\n\\nThank you for your deep insights. , Yeah doing a good deed does not instantly make you a good person and I would bet money part of why Elon did something like this was for reactions like \"Yeah he definitely has my respect now.\" Idk how people are THIS easy to win over lmao , what have you done to help the Ukrainians? , True, but at this point, the only people I’d refuse “aid” from if I were Ukraine, are Poutine, Xi and Kim. , communications during war is SUPER IMPORTANT.  \\nThe reason why this is happening is because putin is actively cutting communications so the ukrainians cannot:  \\ncall for help  \\ncoordinate attacks  \\nexpose any atrocities to the rest of the world the russians are committing  \\nby providing alternative communication methods that cant be interrupted by the enemy during war means Musk will be saving lives. there is not a price or value you can put on saving a life, not to mention multiple lives. it is a universal good  \\nalso remember there are people called war profiteers, who during times of war, will gouge people/entities/governments for needed goods or technologies at exorbitant prices due to \"if you dont have this, you will die\" and Musk is giving it away for free. , Agreed. He doesnt do anything that doesnt serve his self interests , You have no proof the emerald mine used children . Just like he had no proof that diver was a pedo. That article mentions nothing about a stolen mine it did mention his father paid 40k for half of it. And he owned it for 6 years .. we get it you don\\'t like Elon musk . , > Or he will just get your kids to work in his mommy and daddy\\'s emerald mine they stole.\\n\\nThat\\'s false.\\n\\n**Russian disinformation ops have been targeting Elon Musk for years** due to Tesla\\'s threat to crude oil producers & SpaceX\\'s threat to Russia\\'s satellite launch business, and the \"emerald mines\" smear you repeated is one of those countless smears that are 100% false:\\n\\n>  https://savingjournalism.substack.com/p/i-talked-to-elon-musk-about-journalism\\n\\nDon\\'t repeat the smear.\\n\\n> I mean, I\\'m not knocking his generosity, but it is definitely NOT for altruistic \\npurposes.\\n\\nAlso make sure you don\\'t fall for Russian propaganda targeting renewable energy companies like Tesla and new-space companies like SpaceX, and their owners such as Elon Musk. , I see someone else already fact checked you on this, but it\\'s not true. Stop spreading misinformation please! , The exact words said to me by my ex before breaking up with me , I love all the reactionist shit that spun from my absurd comment. look at it all. , In the West, yes, but the resources required to make those cars are largely harvested from the developing world, where a mixture of IMF pressures, poor taxation policy and lobbying from corporations like his ensure that almost no money reaches the people who actually produce in those nations. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[https://gfintegrity.org/press-release/new-report-on-unrecorded-capital-flight-finds-developing-countries-are-net-creditors-to-the-rest-of-the-world/](https://gfintegrity.org/press-release/new-report-on-unrecorded-capital-flight-finds-developing-countries-are-net-creditors-to-the-rest-of-the-world/)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMany of his machines could not have been produced without cobalt from Africa and lithium from Latin America, and even in production terms, Tesla has utilised plenty of sweatshops. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNot everything is about the West. , Elon intentionally sabotages good living wages for Americans. , https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelposner/2020/10/07/how-tesla-should-combat-child-labor-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo/?sh=41cd1b6e5cd0 , *You gotta give the butcher his share*\\r  \\n*You\\'d like to make believe he isn\\'t there*\\r  \\n*You\\'d like to make believe you just receive what\\'s only fair*\\r  \\n*That no one has to suffer to keep you in your chair*\\r  \\n*But you gotta give the butcher his share* , People downvoting you like they forgot about the fucking submarine lol. \\n\\nStill, good on him for donating the Starlink setups, seems like that could easily be put to good use. , I have grown to dislike Elon for various reasons but regardless he\\'s made a lot of really innovative things happen. If there is ever a time to set aside your feelings, it\\'s when someone is providing a vital service during a war. Providing a service unlike anything anyone else is currently able to produce that realistically will save lives. , How is he a conman? Isn\\'t he running several successful companies? Isn\\'t he delivering actual products to customers?\\n\\nI mean, if sending reusable, self landing rockets into space is a con... sign me up! , He didn\\'t get anyone SWATted. Tesla got word that some guy was going to shoot up the place. They did what they were supposed to do - alert the authorities so they could look into it. , hes joker, not iron man?  \\n\\nheh , I mean I get that but how does putin not see sending fighter jets and fighter jets with foreign pilots as the same thing? If his threats against anyone interfering were serious surely he should have an issue with the aid already being provided...\\n\\nAlso this straight up just isnt a proxy war... obviously not for russia, and this is no one elses war but Ukraine\\'s , Like in Syria. We were in a proxy war with Russia, both sides supplying opposition.  We weren\\'t directly attacking each other,  but the US and Russia were basically using the people as puppet. , Please don\\'t make up bullshit like this. Boots from NATO country would mean that NATO is getting involved, and legally we can\\'t do that yet.\\n\\nCivilian volunteers (not members of the armed forces) are getting involved. , > ruining their loved ones lives\\n\\n\\nAs they agonize in pain every day which just gets worse and worse. Begging to end it, till they finally get placed under \"palliative sedation\" - look that term up. And then die in agony. , Their decision is not yours. It\\'s unfortunate and I don\\'t necessarily agree with it either. \\n\\nBut it is their decision to make and theirs only. We can only move on because we are not them and no matter what they tell us, we are not capable of understanding what life is like in their heads. \\n\\n(Spoken from having been to that point many times. Not there now. But none can understand unless they have been there) , You think someone in so much pain that they\\'re willing to kill themselves is actually doing it to mete pain on others? Hilariously, absurdly myopic. Suicide isn\\'t selfish. Insisting that people keep  suffering excruciating pain for your emotional convenience is. , Are you saying it is selfish for someone around you to end their (miserable to no end) life because it means you now have to clean up the mess afterwards? \\n\\nLike im not sure if youre roleplaying a learning disorder or straight up trolling. Theres no way someone can be this disconnected lmao , People choose it not just cos of mental illness. They usually have some form of terminal illness and would rather die with some dignity than live on in pain and than die anyway.\\n\\nMy favorite author, Terry Pratchett, was an advocate of assisted suicide. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer\\'s and often stated that he would rather die before he loses his mind. He supposedly died of natural causes. Many of us suspect it might not be the case.\\n\\nAnd than there\\'s the tragic story of the Verbassem twins. Born deaf at birth, both of them started to become blind at the age of 45. They both chose to assisted suicide rather than carrying on living completely dependent on others.

Good on you for recognizing that shit is bad for your head. Self care is a real and necessary thing. Spend too much time in that head space and you\\'ll start questioning reality unless you are relatively old and your beliefs and ideals have crystallized. , Glad to know I\\'m not alone. I\\'ve always had a crazy fantasy like that scene in Iron Man 1 where he lands out of the sky and shoots soldiers who were kidnapping women and childeren almost killing a father. I sometimes wish I could do that, just fucking land with plot armor and start saving kids and families. I\\'ve been going slightly insane after the Syrian war started and the whole fucking world went to shit year by year and hasn\\'t stopped ever since. , > She’s obviously a crisis actor who was already an amputee!\\n\\nDouble plot twist, she lost her legs in the Russian invasion and occupation of Crimea/Donbas , I\\'m Filipino and most Filipino expats in the US are pro-Trump and jesus, how fucking brainwashed are they to think that Trump wouldn\\'t let this happen when his actions were one of the many reasons why this happened in the first place basically snowballed to this shitshow , > if Trump was in office this never would have happened.\\n\\nThere might be some truth to that. Putin would have still had his very own agent in the white house and wouldn\\'t have been so paranoid. , Don\\'t watch. It\\'s devasting , It’s like the bush did 9/11 crowd. There are always people who have to find conspiracies.\\n\\nNow, I’m not naive. There has been some seriously fucked up shit done by politicians in every democratic/republic country. The 1% vs. 99% is a thing.\\nBut I’m not so cynical that I can’t enjoy seeing the voices on the far left and right with their petty problems get drowned out by something actually serious. , Sparring with conspiracy theorists over Covid stuff for almost two years made me realize that there is nothing so crazy that at least some people will believe no matter what. , Yep. Something along the lines that Biden had Putin do this to take out the people in Ukraine who have dirt on Hunter. \\n\\nIt’s fucking stupid. , Qtards are the best. 🤣 , Sorry what? , Nope, just Napoleon: \"Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.\" , That\\'s just what they\\'d want me to imply. , In a technical sense, it is. Putin conspired to invade a sovereign nation. , Starlink is mostly funded by hedgies that get like 10ms less latency to high frequency trading markets across the Atlantic ocean.  That\\'s his \"whole reason\".  The path to travel from NY -> London is actually faster going up by satellite, and being beamed over.\\n\\nNormal people being able to access it is basically just extra. , That\\'s just what they\\'d want you to imagine, one way or another. , It must be satisfying to be able to deliver just a massive fuck you to Putin. , That doesn\\'t make a lot of sense.  Why draw down to an endgame when you can smother mate? , Yeah, it was pretty bad, but I\\'ll give you points for trying. , I feel like you\\'re missing a - Copy or two at the end of that , There\\'s a huge US market for Starlink.  And people in the US are much more likely to be able to afford the service and equipment compared to other countries that may have a huge need.  So yeah, it seems very reasonable that Starlink can be profitable with US customers alone. , It looks like you shared an AMP link.

Elon managed his feat thanks to govt subsidies. \\n\\nWhich subsidies are you referring to? , When Russia \"went capitalist\" a bunch of assholes got together and stole every utility, manufacturer, business for themselves and then murdered each other until only a handful were left. Oh yeah, and all of them are basically controlled by the government. This isn\\'t exactly the same capitalism you see in America. , Russia isn\\'t really capitalist. Capitalism requires a free market, which Russia does not have. You can\\'t just start a business freely in Russia, anything that competes with the interests of an oligarch will never be allowed to take off. , Going full on mobster is not \\'capitalism\\'. , > What are you trying to say?\\n\\nThat, by-and-large, free, capitalistic societies produce technology and results fastest and furthest as demonstrated by most major inventions in the in the past couple centuries, such as the telephone, automobile, aeroplane, nuclear bomb, fist working solar panel, the internet, most major medicines you take for granted today, and this is off the top of my head.\\n\\nIn comparison to a country where a private contractor would never be allowed to build a rocket, or its own net infrastructure, such as Russia, because they do not have a free market system, the government clamps down on most if not all of this industries and their innovations are seldom. There are no smartphones or electric cars coming out of Russia.\\n\\nA free society is always a capitalistic one, by definition; in a socialist society, the government is your employer and provider.

True, it doesn\\'t abolish the private ownership of capital, but the subordination of capital to the national interest under corporatism wouldn\\'t be considered capitalist by liberal thinkers or states.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s a difference in definitions that has ideological underpinnings so it is unlikely they\\'ll be reconciled anytime soon. , No, I would not be a bilionaire because I donlt exploit people.

To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, “It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.” It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than\\xa0 anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating and drinking establishment, owned by a man who himself is poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking the cruel question: \"If you are so smart, why ain\\'t you rich?”\\xa0\\n(Kurt Vonnegut, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\")\\n\\nIt seems I\\'m far from the only hater. , [Ground stations in Turkey, Poland and Lithuania should give full coverage of Ukraine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/t27mm9/ukraine_official_asks_elon_musk_for_starlink/hykfowi/?context=3) , Whoa whoa whoa.\\n  Curvature of the earth? , From what I understand the satellite to satellite communications systems don\\'t work. That was initially planned but wasn\\'t feasible. , The latest satellites are also capable of meshing. No idea what percentage of the fleet or coverage they have with that feature yet. , Yeah that makes sense. I am not an RF expert either...\\n\\nBut maybe they can filter for the signal from the right direction? I\\'m sure that on the receiving end each chip sees a slightly phase shifted signal, and they must have a synchronized clock source for transmission, so at least they have all the components needed to decode direction.\\n\\nThat said, a strong noise source would overpower all the receivers so even though they could decode the direction of the real signal, they would not see it in the first place. You\\'re probably right on the receiver side being jammable.\\n\\nThe Russians still have to be in line of sight; the frequency starlink uses does not penetrate leaves, which is why trees are usually a problem for most users. Trees might actually help Ukraine because an intermittent signal should still be good, getting signal only when the satellites peek through a gap in the canopy, but foliage would dampen the jamming noise. , They both use directional antennas. From satellite to the earth, the coverage area is the portion on a map where a user can communicate with the satellite. Think about the intersection of a cone with a sphere. Coverage areas are typically on the order of hundreds of miles in diameter. A jammer just needs to be in the coverage area to jam the uplink (communication from the terminal to the satellite). For a metro area, there only needs to be one sophisticated jammer. \\n\\nIt is certainly possible to jam civilian communication systems. Any sort of radio emitter with the right spectrum can dazzle a satellite and a dedicated jammer can destroy the amplifiers used in satellites. Supposedly Russia has such technology. If such electronic warfare vehicles are deployed are another matter. , Kanye is a weirdo and has a lot of issues, he also makes good ass music. , If Kanye\\'s songs were written and performed by his employees and Kanye just walked out on stage between sets to accept all the credit. , Who? , Are you taking the piss? \"Musk is weird but his companies make cool stuff\" Yeah, absolutely jam-packed with nuance lmao. , False equivalency , It\\'s only fraud once you receive money for it and don\\'t deliver. , Unfortunately, yes.

Take a chill pill, no reason to behead him for it. , So Elon got in a pissing match with a nobody and used his resources to try to publicly ruin their reputation without checking the info that he was given. Great guy. Really fantastic. , While you\\'re correct that the diver, Vernon Unsworth, was not on the rescue team, to say he was a nobody is a pretty big claim to make. He was an older local hobby diver who\\'d mapped out the caves and helped extensively with planning the rescue, being the first diver on site as he lived locally. [He literally got an MBE for it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46701985). , Yes exactly.\\n\\nI even remember the guy was talking about selling the rights to a movie and making money on it and him being salty that he was kicked out of the area as the real rescue team found him unhelpful and annoying. , He lived half in Thailand half in the UK. With his wife, who Elon later doubled down on calling a child bride and saying she was 12 when they met; she was a fair bit younger than her husband, but was in her late 30s and a business owner, so this seems to have been entirely based on racist stereotypes against Thai people with the assumption that any Thai woman who marries a white guy was trafficked. Also, Musk really can\\'t talk considering his own propensity for relationships with similar age gaps.\\n\\nFor the sake of accuracy, though, the Brit didn\\'t physically participate in the rescue - he was an older hobby diver who had extensive experience of those specific cave systems so was advising the rescuers, helping them make maps and plan the dive. That might actually have made him more qualified to tell Musk his sub was useless though.\\n\\n\\nLastly, I think a lot of people didn\\'t hear that Musk admitted to *hiring a private detective* to dig up dirt on this guy. He called him a pedo, went on a weird manic rant to BuzzFeed about the guy\\'s wife, then realised he looked stupid so invested money into trying to find anything he could possibly get on the guy. Fully willing to blow up someone\\'s life because they insulted him on TV. , He did, but he wasn\\'t a rescue diver. He was/is a hobby cave mapper and is spending his retirement in Thailand. , He was an expat brit living in thailand with a girlfriend 23 years younger than him. Not pedo territory, but western expats moving to Thailand so that they can meet younger women is definitely a known stereotype. I can understand using it as an insult against someone who it superficially fits, especially after they\\'ve already public called your attempts to help save trapped children a PR stunt. , Hi lives in Thailand and has a Thai girlfriend 23 years younger than him. Definitely not pedo territory age wise, but he superficially fits the stereotype. , I didn\\'t know you could report other people on that line. , True and I don\\'t think he should have done that, but autistic people don\\'t have the best social skills. But there was no reason for that guy to tell him to shove the sub up his ass either. , And? , >  I didn\\'t really care about the drama, since it seemed like the real news was how hard it was to rescue the kids.\\n\\nExactly. , > If I remember the diver sued him over it?\\n\\nThe diver did, and the diver lost the case. , The lawsuit is here\\n\\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4895935-Vernon-Unsworth-vs-Elon-Musk-defamation-lawsuit.html , He wasn\\'t. He assisted the governmental team and he didn\\'t do the dive, because he simply lacked experience. Nothing to do with his age.\\n\\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4895935-Vernon-Unsworth-vs-Elon-Musk-defamation-lawsuit.html , Could be done with copious amounts of duct tape. , They\\'d also be SOL in an emergency since the Dragon only has life support hookups for 4. , Doubt its an issue to install the rest of the seats though..lol , They could just send the suits they need up with the ship. , >\\'requires\\'\\n\\npretty sure it doesn\\'t. Just not going to be comfortable without them. , Funny how an extremely difficult common goal can bring folks together.\\n\\nI didn’t know about this, thanks for sharing. , I highly recommend the series For All Mankind (Apple TV) - it\\'s an alternative history of the space race if the USSR had landed on the moon first. , > if some Russian general or the current lunatic Russian ISS manager decides to run the ISS into US or European soil, as he announced recently, nobody but SpaceX could help them.\\n\\nGround to orbit lasers and missiles exist. While Dragon can evacuate crew. , I would guess the Russians would just defect to the USA and hitch a ride with them? , He\\'s saying the Dragon capsule is capable of station keeping. This was never approved/certified because until now no one thought they needed it. , Oh right, seats on Dragon specifically. My bad. , I feel like making money and being a tech pioneer as a point of pride are just 1a and 1b for him. He definitely sunk more money into SpaceX once he got burned by Russia , Yes and no. Elon did pay himself (almost bankrupted himself, SpaceX and Tesla to fund grasshopper and falcon 1. Winning the cargo launch for NASA (along with others) saved the company..\\n\\nBut it\\'s a moot point anyway. Off cause SpaceX see a big amount of money from government in a market where the primary customer is the government. It\\'s like if a company made chalk, then their primary customers would be government as they uses the most chalk. , I\\'m so tired of people saying this. It is vastly more complicated and costly to terraform mars than to reverse climate change on earth. No one is getting abandoned by the rich. , Yeah yeah yeah, \"eat the rich\" and so on and so forth. Keep whining, and you will indeed be left to rot on this [s] miserable [/s] planet. , Again, I am not completely disagreeing with you on this, and I do hope it will eventually be the case, but it seems you are underestimating the importance of these govt contracts for the long-term viability of SpaceX. They will need the NASA and Air/Space Force contracts going forward for quite some time. , Sexual references? It drives home the point.\\n\\nIt\\'s pretty simple. Stop hero worshiping the guy like he\\'s your Messiah and maybe people will stop reminding you what a piece of shit he is.\\n\\nIf people were reasonable and said, \"Yeah this guy has done a lot of bad things and his families wealth was created on the backs of apartheid slaves but he\\'s also done a lot of good.\" nobody would care. That\\'s a factual statement. \\n\\nHe\\'s done a lot of bad shit. Tesla employees are treated horribly. His wealth all originates from the backs of slavery. He\\'s done terribly shady business practices. It\\'s largely believed a lot of his ideas for Starlink came from Greg Wyler who he cut out of the business planning.\\n\\nHe\\'s also done a lot of good things too. Like getting America away from Russian fossil fuels and rockets. Or providing sources of cleaner energy. Or this situation with Ukraine.\\n\\nHe does a lot of bad and a lot of good. Both are true.\\n\\nBut instead you come in here worshiping him like ignorant peasants and people like me feel the need to educate you morons on the truth since clearly you\\'re unaware of the reality. , Get off your weirdo prude shit boss , Multitasking. , If you want a simple modern comparison look at [SLS vs Starship](https://everydayastronaut.com/sls-vs-starship/). Both are super heavy-lift launch vehicles that are planed to launch for the first time this year. Development of NASA\\'s SLS has cost over $20 billion so far and each SLS launch will cost over $2 billion. Development of SpaceX\\'s Starship has cost less than $10 billion so far and each launch will cost less than $10 million, SpaceX has said their goal is as low as $2 million. In other words a Starship launch will be 0.5% the cost of an SLS launch. That percentage is not a typo. , Nope, NASA is simply too rigid for the development done in SpaceX since it is indeed a gov agency, that\\'s why we gave more money TO NASA  so they could invert in private rockets no one is trying to defund NASA we just found a way to get cheap rockets for NASA (SpaceX and any other company mostly sustains on money from NASA/ESA) why waste money in rockets when others can do it cheaper + you get to have your engineers working in dem cool rovers , The politics in Washington means any rocket made by nasa has to have parts built in every state. Its complicated, expensive, and time consuming. SpaceX can make the entire product in two or three factories tens of  times faster and cheaper. Nasa should do what it does best and make robots. Now that we have crazy cheap ways to space, nasa can spend all its money in science! The Elon haters really can\\'t even fathom what this means for the future of science and discovery. Starship is going to allow us to build giant ships and stations in orbit , Some things are better as public, some are better as private. I don\\'t understand why each aide says  everything should be 100% one or the other. Black and white thinking is retarded , I\\'m not sure I understand... SLS hasn\\'t even gotten their vehicle crew-rated and are massively overbudget and delayed.  Meanwhile SpaceX has developed a direct competitor that is much cheaper as well as actually proven to work.

Starlink was a good start. But let\\'s be honest, he is a billionaire and he could be doing even more. , That\\'s all you got?  You horny to watch man-sucking? , Elon can be an asshole sometimes but at least he tries to do good things and he often does help. On the other hand, you are some loser on the internet who has never done shit. , If you can please list your contributions to humanity then we can compare both lists and see who has been the better human despite their obvious failings. , &#x200B;and again...\\n\\nyou, LadyZeldaia, are also trying to direct attention to you right now.

And because there are many many people on Reddit and many many communities and contexts and many times of the day, sometimes the ones who dislike him win out or the ones who like him win out.\\n\\nWhich is why the concept of a hive mind on many issues is silly. Especially if it’s “schizophrenic”, what you’re saying is that it’s meaningless and without reason, so why bother calling it anything? , I’d agree if we all were fed the same exact feed. We choose what communities we want to see which creates many “hive minds” with only the most popular reaching the front page. , and yet here you are , you track each independent person to see if there mind has changed? is this not a forum of hundreds of thousands of people? , That\\'s because Sunflowers are leeches.  They sap up all the nutrition in the soil, leaving nothing behind but a barren wasteland.  That\\'s why you don\\'t see many sunflower crops anymore.

This fucking conversation is about how polarizing Elon is and how people have such wildly different views of him, to the point where nobody can agree what the \"hivemind\" opinion is.\\n\\nIf the \"hivemind\" is so fucking disconnected that the people in it have completely opposing views, in what way is it a hivemind? , Lol he’s been a billionaire since at least 2012. Everyone has always known that he was filthy rich. His massive success as an apparent outsider was a major part of his appeal.\\n\\nI’m not sure what you’re trying to claim here. , A coup against the democratically elected president of Bolivia.\\n\\nBecause he wanted access to the lithium there. , I 100% believe that. After simple googling, virtually all of the claims against him and his companies, aside from his cringey tweets, are actually false. Most frequent thing people keep bringing up are the emerald mines but a quick google showed that was from an interview where his dad said he was interested in buying 3 shares of one. Pointed that out in a comment once, got a few hundred downvotes. Since then I\\'ve doubted everything I read here. , Anonymous comments and unverifiable leaks… listen to yourself. That’s a delusion. You’re seeing what you want to believe. , You make me blush , ? I’m not coming at him. He owned up to it and apologized. I can respect that he apologized but that doesn’t erase what he apologized about lol. I’m not tweeting about Elon musk constantly. This response is entirely directed to you who wants to downplay what he said as the actions of a whiny baby on the autism spectrum. , Holy shit JUST DON\\'T CALL SOMEONE A PEDO WITHOUT BASIS\\n\\nTHIS IS NOT HARD , What makes you so sure you\\'re writing to a person who is neurotypical? , What if I’m the narcissist but no one knows? , how is tesla successful? , All your comments on this post are defending him and his asshole ways. Your tongue is all over his boot. , You have to say allegedly as a news source or you get sued for libel. \\n\\nThe lawsuit has dozens of witnesses and testimonials. , My point is will tolerate his uhhh oddities because of the shit he actually does. Ensuring Ukrainians will have internet access here could be huge. He can be as cocky as he likes. Whether you like him is neither here nor there and I will not tolerate people taking advantage of this situation to push their own agendas.\\n\\nElon did a great thing today and if you wanna talk shit fuck off to somewhere else. , im not a fanboy. Elon is autistic and says a lot of shitty things. HOWEVER what he has accomplished and what hes doing today speaks volumes. , Oh yeah. I\\'m not a fanboy im just saying hes done a shitload and I think hes a net positive overall. I\\'m fine with his antics from time to time. , </3 that really cuts me deep faceless one 001 , I wish he\\'d repeatedly called you out as a pedophile to his deranged fanbase just to see your reaction.\\n\\nThat controversy is on the tamer side compared to his other ones.\\n\\nWhy are you equating this to kindergarten hijinks ?\\n\\nWas it a little oopsie when he went on his \"COVID is bullshit\" diatribe and kept his factories open during a pandemic despite local orders at the detriment of his workers ?\\n\\nHe isn\\'t your everyday guy with a microscope highlighting his fuck ups, he\\'s a fucking asshole who also does good. , Billy Billionare’s lows put thousands of people out of a job and dominate the headlines for 72 hours.

Should be a fun next two decades in space if he gets to follow his goals. , Basically everything he\\'s done is because he\\'s been planning a mars trip, writing down what tech isn\\'t advanced enough to feasibly be used on mars, and then advancing that tech himself.\\n\\nFucker is driven to escape this planet like nobody else. Respect. , It\\'s well off in the future, but smarter people than you including musk are constantly thinking of ways to make it happen and how it would look. Not that it would, but not being stuck on earth is worth a shot. , I think he is going to try and make it happen, as to it’s success, who knows, but I’m happy with my shares. \\n\\nFsd while far away, is surprisingly good for what it is. It won’t be level 4 anytime soon and it doesn’t really need to be for the company to be worth way more than it is today.

I’m a fan of being open to what dreamers can attempt over shitting on change and claiming I know enough to say something will never come to pass, however unlikely. \\n\\nHe’s an asshole sure, but a great jockey to bet on historically. , I do believe it.

It\\'s why we haven\\'t seen one in real world use even though they\\'ve existed for 5 years.  It\\'s why when Tesla/Elon talks about the truck they talk 0-60 times and never once have mentioned payload.  I don\\'t think trucking companies are concerned with 0-60 times... But they would like to know payload.\\n\\nIt\\'s not possible with today\\'s technology. , You are so high on yourself bro. Found the gender studies major working at Starbucks lmao. Don\\'t you have a daily post to make on /r/antiwork or something , ...the company that has the most advanced rocket tech in the world and has him as the Chief Engineer. , I agree with captain, not sure what source you are citing but I would love a link. Elon didn’t profit from any hyper loop venture and instead only gave money away for a prize for engineering contest on a test track.  It was Branson that invested with others to actually make it real , And from the socialist or communist perspective, every ceo/entrepreneur is a conman in that same regard if they share their aspirational plans with the public. \\n\\nWhen you spread it out to that kind of context, it loses its meaning completely, and just makes you look bitter. \\n\\nAnd in that regard, he is still measurably less of a conman than most entrepreneurs, big business or politicians with the promises they make about future product opportunities. , He never said that. Try to find a source on that. , Yessir , Agreed , Ur a bot , Oh please show me 1 thing he has personally engineered. \\n\\nAnd no, actual entrepreneurs don\\'t try to sell stupid ideas such as underground taxis where a train would be 10000000x better. , They\\'re literally the worst value for money EV on the market. \\n\\nYou\\'re paying premium for musk hype and nothing more. , Not true. Normal cars combust more often due to driver error and accidents, but they don\\'t spontaneously combust when just sitting in a garage. \\n\\nOnly teslas do that. \\n\\nWith a normal car you can just be careful and not catch fire. Teslas don\\'t give you that choice. , How many times have you complained about Putin? , It\\'s actually disgusting how you\\'re pretending to be supporting Ukraine while all you\\'re doing is tonguing musks ass. \\n\\nJesteś gorszy od kacapów, świat będzie lepszy bez ciebie. , >How is it different when self driving is already a product which thousands of users make use of on the road in their Teslas?\\n\\nBecause it\\'s called \"full self-driving\", and it\\'s not.

Like a conditional preorder. Absolutely no con about it. The beta has known capabilities and users buy it with those capabilities in mind.\\n\\nI\\'ve been to a Tesla showroom and did a test drive.  I backed out of buying a Model 3 because even after the salesman assured me that \"you don\\'t even have to keep your eyes on the road with Full Self-Driving\" the car nearly drove me onto some train tracks.  Tesla, the company, is advertising this as something that it is assuredly not.\\n\\n>Anyway, the James Webb example should be enough to convince you that\\'s not how science works. The Webb telescope had approximate completion dates. No scientist or politician in the world thinks the people working on the project, who proposed it, are conmen for completing their incredibly difficult, humanity serving goal late\\n\\nFucking christ.  I have fourteen papers published in the field of fluid dynamics.  Don\\'t try to explain to me \"how science works\" you bellend.  First off, this is a marketing problem, not a scientific revolution.  Second, *Tesla is selling cars with this as a feature*. , Lmao , You are right. Traffic on the Starlink network is encrypted in such a way that not even spacex can read it. However, they know where packets are being routed, which is still useful Intel. , The amount currently spent on space both publicly and privately is really pretty small relatively. I do think that equal amounts of money, if not much much more should be spent on other problems that Earth and humanity are facing, but I think that we’d still be worse off if we abandoned funding on space technology. I’m very sure that there are more than enough resources in the world to do both at once. , We wouldn\\'t be setting up mars for no reason, it would basically be a backup planet it case earth gets fucked in some massive disaster or nuclear war, the human race, or \"mankind\" could live on , Bro I know more about radio\\'s than you do. They\\'re easy to jam. You added nothing to my comment and you\\'re clearly still triggered about it. Anyway it won\\'t matter much in the scheme of things. , Incompetence.  Apathy.  I don\\'t know.  It\\'s relatively straightforward to jam signals. The trick is not jamming your own signals and with satellites you have the added difficulty of needing to be moderately close to the signal path. \\n\\nThe US military is pretty heavily invested in signal intelligence, jamming and other operations.  I can\\'t imagine Russia doesn\\'t have at least a few units devoted to signal operations. , At an altitude of 550km (where starlink orbits), if you\\'re within a 75 km radius of the surface position of the satellite, your signal is only going to be about 8 degrees off axis.  Certainly within the most sensitive lobe of a directional antenna or dish.  And it\\'s not hard to track satellites.  I do it regularly with a yagi...by hand. But again...I\\'m not suggesting that Russia is doing this, but rather that starlink is not the incorruptible access that people want it to be.  If Russia wanted to jam starlink in major cities they could do it relatively easily. , Yeah, that\\'s actually pretty fair. , It’s meant to be subtle , We\\'re allowed to be both correct. , [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v62QkD_q1bs)... in my eyes at least. , I was referencing this exact scene earlier tonight!

There are plenty of things Musk has done that he deserves to be criticized for. This is one of the times where I’m completely fine with *moderately* praising him because he’s doing something good. Would he have done it had it not benefitted him in some way? We can speculate but we don’t really know. The fact is, he’s done it and that’s good enough for a pat on the back in my book , lets wait to see if this is actually usable? he has a track record of not doing what he claims. see: the kids in the cave and his covid machines. , Ukraine asked for these, not the other way around. , Because the people at his same caliber are usually much worse. For a ultra wealthy \"bad guy\" musk is pretty middle of the lane. , An enemy of an enemy is a friend , Billionaires have it so easy. Pay 2% of what you should be paying in taxes in a passion charity project once in a while and monetize and weaponize your good deeds. He has a think tank, too, guys… , In other words, your axe grinding is more important than the lives of all these people.. wow. Somehow you managed to take a situation about someone else and turn it into all about you! Amazing. , I\\'ve been busy co-ordinating with a friend to help finance an exodus of his family from Ukraine to Berlin where they have extended family.   \\n\\n\\nDon\\'t presume I\\'m not doing my part just because I am critical a man who makes his money through exploitation of the working class. , Really? How do you know? Have you spoken to him? Are you his psychologist? How are you so sure you know what his motivations are?\\n\\nHe has repeatedly stated that his aim is to provide a second home for humanity on another planet to prevent our extinction. Now, you may disagree with his aims, but that sounds to me like he has an altruistic goal.  All of his businesses are aimed with that goal in mind.  Solar panels, lithium batteries, electric cars, rockets, boring tunnels, satellites are aligned with the goal to prolong sentient life.\\n\\nNeed proof? Don\\'t believe me?  OK. Here is a quiz for yourself. If you don\\'t know the answer to this question without looking up the answer, then you really have no idea what you are criticizing.  Here is the question: How is Musk going to make rocket fuel on Mars?  If you don\\'t understand why that is an important question and how it could make an important difference on the earth, then you are uninformed and just following what the twitter mob says. , Ouch , Tesla has been working hard on using 0 cobolt and are very close to that goal. Cobolt is also used in refining the oil we use to burn in cars. It is honestly better it ends up in car batteries, at least it can then be recycled. Besides tesla is not using cobolt from child labor.\\n\\nTesla is also not getting litium from Latin America but mostly from Australia and they are also working on a solution to get it from USA. , Tesla gets cobalt from sources that do not use child labor. Same with lithium.\\n\\nWhat sweatshops are you talking about?\\n\\nSeems you are lying again. , Typical thousand sons sorcerer, always nitpicking the achievements of our glorious God-Emporer. , The median salary at Tesla is $160k.

Maybe I should call them pedos or something. , The submarine he made on request from the actual rescue team? Where the rescue team even sent him the specifications? That one? , No, the engineers and workers at his companies have made *some* innovative ideas happen. Musk gets way too much underserved praise. , He has a huge issue with the aid already provided. It’s part of why he put his nuke division on “high alert”. Providing planes and other weapons is still a far cry from putting NATO boots on the ground in Ukraine and essentially declaring WW3. , Fighter jets with foreign pilots won’t engage because it’ll be an act of war. Additionally I don’t think Russia has a large amount of anti aircraft assets because foreign aircraft cannot carpet bomb Ukraine. \\n\\nIn terms of fighter jets, I don’t think they’re as deployable as they sound. Jets usually have more maintenance time than flight time and I’m not sure Ukraine has the systems in place to maintain those aircraft. I’m saying this with limited knowledge on Ukraine military equipment which I’m kinda thinking will be Soviet style (MIG/SU) instead of nato style (F16) based on the history of the nation. \\n\\nThis war isn’t really ukraines either. It’s a proxy war for Europe and the us because Ukraine has always been a buffer state and nato and eu decided to expand towards it. This will hurt Ukraine more than anyone else I’d think , Its like plausible deniability where Putin, unless he truly lost his mind, can ignore it so that he can possibly win still without losing everything by going to real war with NATO or causing a nuclear apocalypse. , It\\'s because our men aren\\'t physically pulling the trigger\\n\\nIt\\'s like an unspoken agreement of world politics\\n\\nYou can fund and send aid to whoever and it might make you some enemies (in this case not so much) but you aren\\'t physically entering your country into the war\\n\\nIt\\'s toeing the line and if the otherside responds by attacking your people for \"simply\" giving aid, then the real shit show begins\\n\\nRussias entire strategy is overwhelming numbers. If other countries but boots on the ground they\\'re absolutely fucked (and then so is probably the world) , That\\'s what the \"emergency loan\" aspect of this is all about. In reality, Western countries are likely just buying arms from their own military industrial complex and giving it to Ukraine but if you can claim, \"hey we just loaned them money to buy some stuff from us. It\\'s not war it\\'s just capitalism.\" Which has the advantage of probably being true 😕 , Reading the replies here but want to add that if, say US trips were involved on the ground or air and there was a casualty, that would 1) look very bad for a politician and 2) might force you getting more involved. I say the above things from the view point of a politician (I’m not one, btw) and not the view from a moral perspective. , That was directed at you saying you sympathize with self-terminators who do so for mental illness. , Intentions matter less than consequences. It\\'s not for my sake, I couldn\\'t give less of a fuck about them if they don\\'t care about me enough to stick arouns. It\\'s all the mutual connections who arent equipped to handle stuff that way that I worry about.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter what happens in my life or how much I\\'m hurting, I would **never** do that to the people who care about me. , Too many psychedelics for any crystalization. , I was in the 7th grade and I went to school one day and we only watched the news all day.  No math, news.  No PE, news.  No English, news.  I watched on loop for a whole school day planes flying into buildings and exploding.  At the time I was an edgy fucking kid, and look back at things I said and want to punch my 7th grade self in the face as hard as I can, but it stuck with me.  After 9/11 everything got shitty. Years of war in Iraq, Afghanistan, The PATRIOT act, 2008 finical crash, countless school shootings, a global pandemic, massive inflation, I will likely never own a home, and now this fucking shit.\\n\\nBro, I\\'m over it.  Fuck war, fuck anyone who wants it.  Fuck stealing land with force.  Fuck it all.  I\\'m broken, I want to work a job that is satisfying, have a garden, and go on hikes.  Not wonder if ONE asshole is going to duck things up even more. I\\'m one good argument away from saying \"Fuck it.  Let\\'s go to war with Russia.  Can it get worse?\" , lol , Precisely. There was a conspiracy, but it wasn\\'t the Illuminati, just a bunch of Russian gangsters. , That\\'s not a \"technically\".\\n\\nAnd I hate that everyone collectively believes Conspiracy Theory is crazy people bullshit.\\n\\nThe CIA coined the term in order to ridicule and discredit people who were legitimately seeing corrupt shit in the government.   Shit like MK ULTRA.\\n\\nI\\'ll put it this way.  If someone were to come forward and say...\\n\"The government has purposely given an entire community of people an STD and lied to them about it.  Telling the people that it was a vitamin shot or *vaccine* so that they could study the effects of Syphilis when it goes untreated for a lifetime, unchecked, in a poor black neighborhood.\"\\n\\nOh no!  It\\'s a conspiracy theorist!  Some far right wing nut job claiming government is intentionally hurting people for data that was already established and understood, and covering it up with \"free healthcare\" that was really just saline or placebo.  *Shun Him!*\\n\\nExcept that definitely already happened with the Tuskegee Experiment.  And it was considered unethical as *fuck* back then, which is why they lied about it.   \\n\\nOr here\\'s a good one.\\n\"The government has taken despicable war criminals and saved them from execution, given many a new identity, and *employs them in their respective fields of study* because they want to become the only superpower on the planet.  Those people tortured and did unspeakable things to human beings, and they get a free pass because the thirst for power is unsatiable.\"\\n\\nExcept, Operation Paperclip.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe governments of the world have a long and storied history with doing shit they should have been executed for.  Hell, the whole bullshit about Roswell being a UFO/Weather balloon/spy balloon was a perfect example of government fabricating a story that is outlandish and insane, just to keep folk off the real happenings.  There is no \"truth\" in the Roswell story because of how many lies were told.  All originated from the government.  Because of that fuck up, we now have David Icke telling people that a royal jewish lizard family runs the world, but they shape shift into the Queen of England and George Bush.  \\n\\nLook at COVID.  \"It\\'s from a wet market\".\\nNope, definitely from the lab in Wuhan.  Definitely not a natural sample and has been engineered to some extent.  Definitely engineered and patented by one of the pharmaceutical companies that developed a vaccine.  Fauci definitely said that masks were not effective, then backtracked and said they were effective and we should wear them, at the same time telling people that N95 was *not effective* at stopping transmission.   \\n\"The vaccine will end this\".  Transmission and deaths have gone up *substantially* since the vaccine because it does not prevent you from contracting, transmitting, or dying, and there\\'s good evidence that the variants are directly caused by the vaccine because it adapted as a result of the aforementioned shortfalls of the vaccine.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe folks wearing tinfoil are usually pretty damned accurate.  Remember Snowden?  How he exposed the government doing things that are wholly illegal?  There were lots of folks talking about how the government was spying on us all since the 90s.  But they were labeled crazy.\\n\\nQAnon is probably either a neckbeard troll, or it could just as easily be a team of *government* neckbeards purposely waging a psychological war against the people who aren\\'t going to give up whatever the government wants to take away.  The Qanon assholes marched on the Capitol because they were goaded into it by someone.  Then, over multiple days, FBI had aggravators in the crowd trying to incite violence.  Don\\'t think that\\'s a thing?  What about the BLM summer?  Random pallets of bricks appearing day of, then disappearing after the inevitable violent crackdowns by police.  They *caught* aggravators at those rallies.  UC police and such.\\n\\n\\n\\nConspiracies *always* crop up because government *always* is doing something wrong.  Right now, you don\\'t notice any because nobody has had time to catch the discrepancies yet. , That\\'s what they want you to think. , You’re too kind. Appreciate you. , I would be chocked if us market is over 20% of total market. \\n\\nYou are not as rich as you think you are. , Plenty of problems with capitalism and croney capitalism in the USA, certainly, but exactly yes, we still have less corrupt, more regulated capitalism than many many many other nations. \\n\\nHard for my liberal team to not see capitalism in black and white terms. Groupthink sucks :/ , > This isn\\'t exactly the same capitalism you see in America.\\n\\nSounds awfully similar, though. , Is this a joke account? , >\\nIn comparison to a country where a private contractor would never be allowed to build a rocket, or its own net infrastructure, such as Russia, because they do not have a free market system\\n\\nRussia\\'s current system is a free market economy\\n\\n>\\nA free society is always a capitalistic one, by definition\\n\\nFirst off, if we\\'re going by literal definitions you can also freely kill whomever you want in a \"free\" society.\\nSecond off, in practice, unregulated capitalism **always** leads to some form of oppression. Humans love to use their freedom to oppress others and will continue to do so. There a countless examples throughout history with the Big Four from California serving as a prime display.\\n\\n>\\n in a socialist society, the government is your employer and provider. You are completely dependent upon the system, and in fact, enslaved by it (you cannot simply choose to \"not work\", whatever the job you are assigned).\\n\\nThat\\'s simply, by definition and practice, wrong.\\n\\nLastly, what Elon and SpaceX did in the story could\\'ve been done under any practicing economy. , I think the confusion comes from people calling America capitalist. We are a corporatist state, we were teetering for a while but citizens united pushed us thoroughly over the edge. , I didn\\'t even compliment him; I just stated facts and you got all hot and bothered. Apparently you\\'re the one catching feelings. , Sure, for some definition of idiot that makes sense. , You seem to be confused. Nobody here is saying to worship wealthy people because of their wealth. Elon started and is running the most advanced rocket company on the planet, he joined Tesla and took it from a tiny company to one that revolutionized the auto industry (while working at SpaceX mind you), he was part of the team that made online payments possible, etc. You can\\'t argue in good faith that he isn\\'t impressive even if he\\'s an asshole.\\n\\nYour post frames American culture in the worst light, but let me frame it another way: \\n~~poor Americans are urged to hate themselves~~ the American people are urged to create a better life for themselves. Plenty of poor immigrants come to the US and start a business or study to become doctors and enjoy a happy life, my parents being among them. Try being born poor in most other countries and see how easy it is to make an honest and comfortable living. \"If you are so smart, why ain\\'t you rich?\" then becomes \"If you\\'re so smart then you should be able to improve your own life and hopefully that of others around you.\" , Yes! The Earth has curves, and is not afraid to use them. , I believe the V2 satellites will, but they need Starships to get them to orbit. , Incorrect.  However it wasn’t possible to put laser comms on the first gen starlink  sats\\n\\nThe current gen sats being launched do have lasers but they are a small portion of the constellation , The last 6-7 launches have all had the satellite interlinks, but they\\'re still raising their orbits, and there\\'s not enough of them to really impact. In the next 6-9 months, we should start to see some really good connections there. , Can confirm. I only listen to Kanye while straddling a speaker. , And of course, Elon and Kanye are good friends irl. Allegedly they bonded over having bipolar disorder. , Yeezy , I think you forgot the part about his issues. The nuance is that he can both be an imperfect person who does some bad things, but also do some good for the world. In the current age, even that little bit of nuance is lost on most. , More nuance than most internet discussions; we\\'re kind of grading on a curve here. , Well it\\'s certainly more nuanced than the \"RICH MAN BAD\" style arguments most people are making. , [So…](https://www.lipstickalley.com/threads/elon-musk-promises-full-self-driving-next-year-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row.4793605/#:~:text=I%20said%20nine%20times%2C%20not%20eight%21%20Oh%20wait—here,by%20itself%20from%20Los%20Angeles%20to%20New%20York.) , \"if someone isn\\'t a nervous wreck like me they\\'re a narcissist\" , Nah, I just think it\\'s important with stuff like this to draw it back to the foundational issues.  I totally agree with the person I was responding to. , Adam Smith\\nMonday 28 June 2021\\nFrom the independent\\n\\n“We went to this guy’s prefab and he opened his safe and there was just stacks of money and he paid me out, £80,000, it was a huge amount of money,” Errol Musk said, according to Business Insider. Errol Musk was then made another offer: to spend £40,000 on an emerald mine. “I said, ‘Oh, all right’. So I became a half owner of the mine, and we got emeralds for the next six years,” Errol Musk said.\\n\\nAs a result of this, the teenage Elon Musk once walked the streets of New York with emeralds in his pocket. His father said: “We were very wealthy. We had so much money at times we couldn’t even close our safe,” adding that one person would have to hold the money in place with another closing the door. “And then there’d still be all these notes sticking out and we’d sort of pull them out and put them in our pockets.”\\n\\nDon\\'t be a simp for a billionaire you owe nothing to. They profited off of apartheid and they deserve none of your sympathy. Elon also forced out the founders of Tesla and took credit for their work. You\\'re either a Musk fanboy or an idiot. Be better. , yeah, thats what I meant, thx , I will admit I only have basic understanding because I\\'m from far abroad. As far as I know they are far right activist calling for removal of pandemic restrictions and opposing vaccinations... so a lot more people could suffer and die? Sorry, I don\\'t understand logic of those people. Plus they engage in vandalism and uncivil behavior during their protest.\\n\\nThis article describes it a bit more: https://www.nytimes.com/article/canada-trucker-protests.html\\n\\nAnd here is one of Elon\\'s tweets, posted in context supporting those far-right truckers https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1486772334635536395 , Yeah I’m the angry one lol , You’re correct. I have never once angrily called someone a pedophile. Have you? I’ve maybe used motherfucker or asshole, but pedophile is a pretty specific slur with some pretty heavy implications. \\n\\nAnd if you think this is him being beheaded, imagine if I was accusing Elon of wanting to have sex with children. It would be truly awful of me to accuse someone, with no proof, of such a heinous crime. , He didn\\'t get in a pissing match.\\n\\nHe was asked to help, did what he could to help, and got nothing but shit from everywhere. Then this nobody who inflated his importance in the rescue mission goes on live TV and starts attacking him too.\\n\\nThat was the final straw, I guess. How would you feel if you had gotten nothing but shit for days after you responded to a request for help, and then some guy who claimed he was an authority on the matter attacked you on live TV?\\n\\nHe shouldn\\'t have called the guy a pedo of course, but consider the context here. Elon Musk is only human. He is also on the autism spectrum, so his reactions may not always be the same as everyone else\\'s. , He was falsely representing himself as on the rescue team. , Just so you know, this is completely incorrect. The guy Elon Musk called a pedo was a local caving enthusiast who had mapped the system the team was stuck in and was the first diver on scene. He helped contact other British divers to fly over to help, was a major part of planning and [later received an MBE for his efforts](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46701985).\\n\\nAlso, they are making a movie about it. It\\'s got Aragorn in. The guy also featured in a few documentaries [and a kind of weird music video](https://thethaiger.com/news/bangkok/the-isan-project-honours-a-hero-of-tham-luang-cave-rescue) , I remember this now....I couldn\\'t remember exactly why I despised Musk, but reading this I now remember why.  But I will give him a lot of credit for the Starlink now....even though he probably only did it to boost his image/ego, it will still save many, many lives. , Elon is 14 years older than Talulah Riley (his second wife his left his first wife for because she grieved the loss of their child) \\n\\nElon is 17 years older than Amanda Grimes, who he got pregnant.\\n\\nHe\\'s 23 years older than the woman he\\'s dating right now.\\n\\nA couple more divorces under his belt and he\\'ll be hunting for Epstein\\'s phone book. , I think it\\'s a bit misleading to note the fact that this guy\\'s girlfriend is 23 years younger than him without also noting that she is in her early 40s and was in her 30s when they met. Also, according to interviews with family from the time, they met in the UK and he had not previously been to Thailand. \\n\\nThere\\'s an awful lot of assumptions about this stuff, from Musk but also from his defenders, that really teeters towards racist stereotyping of Thai women and their level of romantic and sexual agency. , That\\'s just dumb as fuck, the stereotype of a pedo is being attracted to children. You yourself point out that, but then go on to contradict yourself. , Is it routine for autistic people to call others pedophiles ?\\n\\nThis goes beyond not having the \"best social skills\" it\\'s called being an asshole.\\n\\nHis sub wasn\\'t useful and it was a PR stunt, the guy actually helping called him out.\\n\\nThere is no equivalence between the two and no amount of \"but\\'s\" will change that. , I don\\'t think any autistic people would\\'ve called the diver a pedophile in that same situation. Elon just has a massive ego and can\\'t handle any form of criticism. , So you admit he was on the team lol. You do understand that \"the team\" wasn\\'t just the actual people who physically made the dive.\\n\\nE: also, that document you linked reiterated everything I wrote. It has multiple pages about how crucial he was for the dive and the ways in which he assisted the team. I don\\'t understand how you think that\\'s a gotcha. , [Like this guy?](https://thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/duct2.jpg) , All of Dragon\\'s thrusters are very angled and don\\'t face straight back. They\\'d take serious efficiency hits to use them for station keeping. Not impossible, but very inefficient and would run deep into safety margins for little effect on the station. , I think you are correct here. His success has been due to R&D (partly helped by Russian rocket designs) and funding from NASA (also private investors). Around the same time spacex was in its infancy  NASA was trying to cut costs by privatizing the space industry. , And they need the SpaceX launches. Win win , Good insight, no one does everything right 100% of the time and it’s disingenuous to pretend Elon Musk is an exception. , Must down vote hard factual numbers because emerald man said mean thing once , You are missing his point, you are comparing what a private company has done in 10 years vs what a far better funded government agency may have been able to do in 50. , >The politics in Washington means any rocket made by nasa has to have parts built in every state.\\n\\nSource for \"any rocket built by NASA has to have parts built in every state\"? , Better funding == better talent acquisition == better tech , He is a billionaire because of his % ownership of Tesla / SpaceX he has plans for those two companies that have not been completed yet, so it would make no sense to sell his position. For all intents most of his time is also taken up working in those companies, leaving little for other endeavours. So he tries to help where he thinks he can. Hence free communications access for Ukraine. , Doesn\\'t need to wait for a crisis that is getting media attention to help. There are dozens of things he could do right now to help our country and many others but there is nothing in it for him.  \\n\\n\\nI am glad he sent the starlink gear but I would have liked it more if he sent fucking food.... , what I do or not do in my daily life is not the point of this post or even conversation, I dont need to justify myself to you and I have enough self respect than to brag about shit that I do irl to some cuck online  \\n\\n\\na billionare sending help to a people suffering under a warmongering fascist is litarerly the least they could do after having profited of the same shit  \\n\\n\\nthe starlink shit is amazing, I love that he sent them, but that does not mean he os forgiven or should be praised, it means that innocent people can now have a better chanse of winning this, its not about musk, you or me, its about ukraine , oh? you want a list? well I can say a lot about what elon have done to make people hate minorites and his actions to them, but then again, thats not what this post is about, this entire subreddit now is about fighting for ukraine, cant you musk fanboys see that?  \\n\\n\\nalso, it really is as I thought, any post about elon you guys come and make it 100% about him, ignoring everything else, there are literal fascists killing children and you guys go around spouting shit that elon said so it must be true , EDIT: replied to wrong comment , Why attack someones look though? Completely uncalled for. You should be ashamed of yourself. Why don\\'t you show us a picture of yourself?

Elon Musk has been a massive net positive for humanity, despite his shortcomings.\\n\\nI actually have a significant project in my life that is bringing people together because Elon Musk generated so much enthusiasm for space exploration by being on the verge of making it so accessible.\\n\\nI\\'ll ALWAYS hold people accountable, but I will also defend people from being raked over the coals over things that are water under the bridge.\\n\\nBut you, like so many people, keep bringing it up to satisfy *something,* I don\\'t know what.\\n\\nWe should be sinking hedgefunds who rape small businesses. Bezos routinely steals IP and rapes smaller businesses that pose a threat; HE should be the focus of attacks, not Elon, generally.\\n\\nBezos is the one building a Yacht that will require a historic Dutch bridge to be dismantled.\\n\\nElon Musk is generally alright and doing good things, with a few flaws in his approach (i.e. he can pay more taxes and be a little easier on his employees). Jeff Bezos, on the other hand, can suck a dick. , really, what else is there to say? he said dumb shit. it comes with judgement and consequences, even if you apologize. \\n\\n\\nbest way is to not be an asshole to begin with. also, how much has it hurt him in the end? none. musk stans are more butthurt by it than Elon himself is. He doesn\\'t care. , He apologized, it\\'s over now.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t like double down or act like it was okay after he got over it.\\n\\nMaybe I should rake you over the coals for eternity for typing in all caps and being unforgiving on reddit. , Completely off topic, but is your username your name?

What he is doing is very good yes, but other actions shouldn\\'t just be forgotten. This comment section is about discussing Elon. The good and bad, so no I won\\'t view him in a biased way like you are viewing him. , Typical Elon fanboy. Let someone else suck his dick for a bit, jesus. , You literally posted an interview with Musk himself?\\n\\nAre you fucking delusional? Of course the guy is going to tell a reporter that he didn\\'t inherit vast wealth and that he went to Canada with \"just $2,000\" in his pocket.\\n\\nThe guy is a megalomaniac he wants you idiots to think he\\'s a rags to riches story and he\\'s some fucking Einstein.\\n\\nHe\\'s not.\\n\\nHe\\'s Donald Trump\\'s \"Small loan of a million dollars.\"\\n\\nIgnorant fucking peasant. , Incredible come back bud. Well done. , yea, when he said the share price, hinting at a split, but said nothing about market cap being too high?\\n\\nThere are thousands of people who have done much more extensive research than a single Elon tweet. You\\'re out of your league. , Only if he goes first. Then I\\'m 1000% behind his Mars fantasy. If he goes on the first flight and never comes back, I support it. \\n\\nEven if he bitches out and doesn\\'t have 100% confidence, let him follow his dreams. Just not with taxpayers money, use his own money, Mars on! , Mars has a completely different climate to Earth’s and does not support life. You would have to fully replicate the environmental conditions under which humans and the ecosystems upon which it depends can survive and prosper. Smarter people recognize that this is an impossibly deep challenge, even on a very small scale, requiring vast resources and tech that doesn’t exist outside of fiction. To believe that colonizing Mars is a realizable or worthy alternative to living on a planet that we as a species have specifically adapted to over millions of years is folly. It is a folly borne of sci-fi fantasies and techno-optimism run amok. Think about it for a second, how can we expect to relocate civilization to a barren, irradiated planet when we struggle to cope with or exert any control against Earth’s changing climate?\\n\\nBtw, Musk brands himself as a smart guy but he did not personally design any of his companies’ tech and at most he is a very talented swindler. Feel free to provide any proof to the contrary. , Damn right, I’m betting on the guy that reaches for the impossible and misses half the time instead of the ones sitting in the corner saying it won’t happen.\\n\\nThose people are the reason we don’t have hover boards in 2022.\\n\\nHe’s different for sure but one of the few with his skill set and drive that is actually trying to do some good in the world, rather than just fucking off to a private island. , Tesla vehicles are not even close to self-driving so let’s be clear on that. Musk has marketed the driver assistance software as equivalent or almost as good as FSD, which it plainly is not. Developing FSD tech at an acceptable level of reliability is incredibly difficult and possibly infeasible. Even so, Tesla’s ‘self-driving’ capabilities are demonstrably weak compared to other driverless tech (Google’s autonomous driving software was better and they had the integrity not to bring it to market because of its inherent limitations & dangers).\\n\\nTesla is also most definitely not mass market. It is a brand of luxury vehicle with serious reliability issues. Making cars serviceable, long-lasting, and reliable for everyday, long-term use is far more challenging than anything Tesla has accomplished technologically, and Tesla cars are notoriously troublesome to maintain or repair because that’s not what they are designed for.\\n\\nI’ll grant that SpaceX has done some legitimate work, even if Musk lied to investors about his rockets being cheaper (they are now the most expensive). The notion that interplanetary colonization is on the horizon, however, is not something even worth betting on - it’s a sci-fi dream that if realized would be disastrous. Humans can barely control Earth’s environment and we are biologically entwined with it. Mars is a barren, alien planet that cannot support human life and no single company, let alone one run by Musk, is going to manufacture an artificial environment with all of the intricate requirements for existence we take for granted on Earth. That would be ludicrous to expect. But Musk makes money by selling dreams that appeal to Silicon Valley types and other hapless tech enthusiasts, then profiting from the hype. His businesses are frequently on the brink of bankruptcy and every time it is he makes dishonest promises that rake in speculative capital and government subsidies. Betting on Tesla etc is good in the short term but for the wrong reasons - the bubble always bursts eventually. , Okay, then putting things into use. Clearly he has teams of scientists figuring these things out or he wouldn\\'t be able to make rockets and some of the best electric cars , I don\\'t think they have delivered any yet, but they have working prototypes they have been using for a while internally.  \\n\\n[https://www.autobodynews.com/index.php/western/item/24646-tesla-semi-new-prototype-working-alongside-giga-nevada-s-regular-fleet.html](https://www.autobodynews.com/index.php/western/item/24646-tesla-semi-new-prototype-working-alongside-giga-nevada-s-regular-fleet.html)\\n\\nhttps://insideevs.com/news/567878/tesla-semi-status-megacharger-update/ , I see nothing in there about them being too heavy for bridges. , Untrue.

The prize for the competition was a total of $150,000. \\n\\nSaying he didn\\'t profit off it is just a lie. , Nah, ceo/entrepreneurs have ideas that are grounded in reality and that they have the intention of fulfilling. \\n\\nConmen just build up hype to get money, like Elizabeth Holmes. \\n\\nThat\\'s musk\\'s strategy. , I never understand this argument. I can prove to you that he\\'s an engineer. I can also prove to you that he is the CEO of two companies that employ thousands of engineers.

This guy isn’t making extreme claims, so *you* should shut the fuck up and stop being a dick. , >\\tThis is how you do a quote, idiot , Would still probably take a bit more than the word of someone else before I’m touting it to millions of people, undoubtedly effecting (affecting?) their reputation. \\n\\nIf it was a fit of rage like you claimed earlier, calling someone that so hastily is undoubtedly wrong. If it was a thought out, backed up statement like you’re claiming now, the proof better be damning before you publicly make that accusation. Evidently the claims were false, so there could not have been sufficient evidence to warrant that type of claim. There are 14 peoples whose word I would take as worth repeating. The alleged victim, the defendant, and the 12 on the jury. No one else’s matters. \\n\\nI’m not chastising Elon for hearing the info. I’m chastising him for then repeating that info, thereby putting his own credibility behind it. , There was a core rescue team soliciting help from Elon. He was just a helper on the side, talking shit to Elon , He was not on the rescue team. The rescue team were the heroes who risked their lives to save those kids. ,  [Fourth page of the document you just linked]( https://imgur.com/eGcc8T7.jpg) , So Elon is a pedo too then right? He keeps dating younger and younger women as the older women leave him and report that he is controlling and manipulative.\\n\\nHow much younger is he going to go as these women keep fleeing? Until he\\'s married to an actual child that\\'s easier to control? , Btw that same guy said that he was disappointed when he saw photos of the sub, that Elon visiting the cave was \"showboating\" at a point when it was clear the sub wouldn\\'t work and that it detracted from the ongoing rescue operation. \\n\\nHe also called the guy who insulted Elon \"pivotal to the entire operation\". It was Musk who spread the idea that the insulter played a lesser role in the rescue - in reality he was very involved throughout. , I knew what you linked before clicking it.

I’m talking about the posts that hit the front page and the few top comments, not every single comment in a thread of thousands of comments. \\n\\nI thought that was obvious.

Anyone that helps Ukraine deservers massive respect. However I always think it\\'s best to look at something from all angles and all actions should be discussed. , Not at all actually. I can fully acknowledge he did a good thing while also not forgetting the terrible things he\\'s done. A good deed doesn\\'t negate past bad ones, and certainly doesn\\'t give a person carte blanche to continue their antics. Ironically, the person having trouble being able to juggle two different ideas about someone at the same time seems to be you. , depends on the year I suppose. I got a 50 P/E in 2028 after about $140B in gaap earnings for 2027 , Lol, I’m interested to see how you came to that conclusion re: revenues. Are you including the revenues from EV credit sales which Tesla has relied upon for years to post profits? Not sure I’d count that as having anything to do with the market.\\n\\nTesla shipped less than 1M cars in 2021 (close to that many have been recalled, interestingly). How does that qualify as ‘mass market’? Tesla cars are at the bottom of reliability rankings and build/maintenance issues are well documented. They are not affordable or fit for common consumers.\\n\\nAlso, what is your standard of good in terms of FSD? That makes a big difference. I’m sure it works most of the time in normal circumstances but Tesla is no closer to full autonomy than Google was and it still makes errors that cost people’s lives. The reliability requirements to consider full unsupervised FSD safe for the road are a lot more stringent than you seem to think, and Musk has made bold promises on this front that have never come to fruition (eg robotaxis).\\n\\nIf you’re going to discount my criticisms as trolling and not seriously consider the fraud & safety/labour violations afoot in Musk’s companies & personal business conduct, then perhaps you should examine your own biases. , ah so its limited in range? Okay... I dont see how this makes them unable to use bridges as in your op.\\n\\nCan you help me out? , Link to the paper then.\\n\\nYou really shouldn\\'t trust me or them. Trust yourself. The calculations are quite easy and simple. , His sources prob from YouTube videos and the headline of a news article , Sorry but I have better things to do than hunt down sources for you, and idc about changing your mind. , I\\'m claiming that the majority of his promises to investors are false, just like Holmes\\' were. \\n\\nAnd like I\\'ve already mentioned, spacex is on the verge of bankruptcy. Look it up. \\n\\nAnd just because people are buying teslas due to musk\\'s fake hype doesn\\'t change the fact that they are terrible value as seen by the insane number of recalls, spontaneous combustions and the EV market moving away from them. , It\\'s really not any more pathetic than what you\\'re doing. Defending someone doesn\\'t mean you want to clean their shaft with your mouth. Sometimes it\\'s recognizing nuance. Both blind hate and blind admiration are bad. Musk does some good, he does some bad. The world is far more complex most of the time than that dealing in absolutes. , They also literally have the word \\'Beta\\' on it.\\n\\n\\n\\nBETA. You said you are a scientist, do you not know what beta means? \\n\\n\\nIT LITERALLY MEANS IT\\'S NOT COMPLETE. , The other person does not understand that I am angry Elon hurts strangers. , Yes. I don\\'t call people pedos because they disagree with me and then try to ruin their life. That means I am morally better than Elon. , Shit, my bad. Unfortunately I still look at /r/dogecoin occasionally and that\\'s not sarcasm for some people , Nonsense. I\\'m criticizing Elon for his long track record of being a crazy person and his many, many failures. , Much of his \"innovations\" were performed by large teams of scientists whose names remain unmentioned and who remain without fame or proper recompense for the work they did. He sacrifices capital to make capital, but beyond a certain point he is reaping seeds that other people\\'s labor has sown, for the sake of his own material interest. It is not about ideals, it is about public relations. , Are you referencing this? \\n\\n>NATO welcomes Ukraine’s and Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO.  We agreed today that these countries will become members of NATO.  Both nations have made valuable contributions to Alliance operations.  We welcome the democratic reforms in Ukraine and Georgia and look forward to free and fair parliamentary elections in Georgia in May.  MAP is the next step for Ukraine and Georgia on their direct way to membership.  Today we make clear that we support these countries’ applications for MAP.  Therefore we will now begin a period of intensive engagement with both at a high political level to address the questions still outstanding pertaining to their MAP applications.  We have asked Foreign Ministers to make a first assessment of progress at their December 2008 meeting.

One of those is going after corrupt elements in the applicant\\'s country. That quote is just welcoming Ukraine and Georgia to the beginning steps of becoming a NATO member. \\n\\nBasically, Ukraine asked NATO to join, NATO said: \"Sure, but before you can join, you need to clean your country up and tackle the corruption issues.\" Which Ukraine began doing, then Russia invaded Georgia who also wanted to join and received a similar response, then Putin\\'s puppet chickened out and decided to keep Ukraine neutral until he was forced out in 2014, at which point Russia was now forced to invade to Crimea to keep Ukraine out of NATO similar to how they did Georgia. Yanukovych was keeping Ukraine in line with Russia. With him gone, Russia\\'s only remaining maneuver in their playbook was an invasion. , Ok so I\\'m not totally crazy... just seems to me at this point NATO/US/whoever might as well get involved, but I guess no one wants to push the envelope on that more than whats already been done.. rightfully so , Bro. The moral failure is on your part. So selfish to put your \"feelings\" above someone who is willing to take their own life because of their suffering. You think your suffering from their death is worse than theirs being alive? , But you\\'d be selfish enough to keep someone alive who wishes with their whole being to die simply because you don\\'t want to deal with grief, as though you would be stopping death when in reality all you\\'re doing is delaying it until you can feel okay about it? , Weird flex but ok , The fact you keep talking about your pain and not taking into account theirs makes it seem quite selfish. \\n\\nWhich is human. But know they are allowed to be selfish in the same way you are. Their pain is theirs. Yours is yours. You can only handle your pain and not others. Help? Yes. Handle? No. , I will never know because I could not be paid enough to read a self-published novel about conspiracies that starts with \"That\\'s not a \\'technically\\'.\" , That\\'s what I said in my last comment.

Nothing I said is untrue even if you disagree. I even included the part that his dad bought half.

He made that accusation because his attitude is that of a dime-a-dozen raging insecure little manbaby twitterholic.\\n\\nHis accusation was baseless, but genuine. I challenge you to judge everyone’s actions as charitably as you judge muskrat’s. Or judge his as critically as you judge everyone else’s. \\n\\nGo on, try it.

But that\\'s not what the protest is about. \\n\\nIsn\\'t that framing of Elon misinformation? , Yeah, you\\'re confused. The rescue team didn\\'t solicit help from Elon; when he emailed one of the divers about the sub his team was already proposing, the diver merely told him to keep developing it as they were still in the process of working out how to get the smallest boy out at that point. \\n\\n**The same diver**, by the way - who was the lead rescuer and is going to be played by Viggo Mortensen in the upcoming movie adaptation! -  said he was \"*acutely disappointed*\" when he saw actual photos of the sub, and that \"*there must have been a point when surely his engineers discovered it was not possible, and what happened from that point, when he decided to bring it on site and showboat … you can decide for yourselves.*” \\n\\nHe also said that Elon\\'s visit “*detracted from the rescue effort*” and stated that the guy you\\'re calling \"a helper\" was \"*pivotal to the entire operation*\", so, yeah. , You’re completely missing the point. It doesn’t really matter whether he was a helper or an aide or on the team or literally a crazy man on the side of the street. , Completely arbitrary definition of \"team\", but [here\\'s an article that mentions how he risked his life by making dangerous reconnaissance dives as one of the first on the scene](https://thethaiger.com/news/bangkok/the-isan-project-honours-a-hero-of-tham-luang-cave-rescue) and [here\\'s the lead diver calling him \"pivotal to the entire operation\"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45551895.amp) , Says something different than you wrote, yes. , I don\\'t think either of them are pedos? Elon\\'s just an asshole who got into a fight with another asshole on twitter and decided to insult him by calling him a pedo. , That\\'s new to me, guess I\\'ll need to take a look thanks , I hope you get the help you need. , Once again, a bunch of people with similar interests gathering in one place and then agreeing on a thing doesn\\'t make it a \"hivemind\". Things that get to the front page are, inherently, popular things that the population likes. If you went into a pizza place and started saying that pizza sucks ass, it wouldn\\'t be a \"hivemind\" when everyone tells you to fuck off.\\n\\nI\\'ve been on Reddit for years. I get that you have to try and paint me as not knowledgeable because you have literally nothing else to stand on, but please try harder next time. , 100% , nah. I literally started off with a comment saying i was cool with his shit and antics as long as he does things like this. But i guess thats too much dick suckin. , And still less recalls than other brands, and those recalls were mostly software updates. You are just repeating the same old bullshit now. \\n\\nThose credits that the competition would rather pay Tesla for instead of clean up their fleets now account for a minuscule amount of their automotive gross margins now that they have begun to produce at scale, and that is before their two new factories that the competition paid for come online. The cars are real as well as the margins. \\n\\nFor a level 2 system on highways, the standard autopilot is by far best of breed, and the fsd is making good steady progress towards level 3, although I don’t expect it this year like elon hopes. Every update has improvements tho, so that is better than the competition. Even if robotaxis never happen, their valuations are still fine. I think the problem of general fsd is clearly a tougher nut to crack than Elon’s optimism when it comes to timelines, but where you seem to those aspirational goals as life or death promises just so that you can be offended. Your criticisms are just bad faith misrepresentations of the facts, that’s why I’m accusing you of trolling. \\n\\nHate him for the pedo comments or the shitty Covid takes, etc. He does plenty of stupid shit, so why do you need to keep making shit up? , The paper is quite clear.

That\\'s it. , So you spent time on Reddit replying to a dozen people but you conveniently “don’t have time” when people ask you for sources? , Oh man that’s rich. \\n\\nSpacex stock just did a 10-1 split and have more private cash being thrown at them than they need. \\n\\nThey have had less recalls than other manufacturers, and most of them are fixed by Over the air software updates. \\n\\nTheir market share among all vehicles keeps growing, so the percentage of just ev’s isn’t really relevant provided Tesla sells every car they make and they keep growing at 50% per year. \\n\\nIt was the bolts that were told not to park inside due to combustion risk and were all recalled, that’s Chevy. \\n\\nWhat promises to shareholders has been broken for either firm?  Sure he is delayed a lot, and has some nut job ideas and is a dick to many people, but he has not lied to us like Holmes faked their data. \\n\\nI get hating the guy because he is a dick, but making shit up and spreading misinformation because of that hatred doesn’t help make your case or argument. , SpaceX is privately owned.  If they went public they could raise shit tons of money.  Musk has said he doesn\\'t want to do that because getting to mars is not profitable.\\n\\nThe fact that SpaceX exists as all is a bloody miracle.  Something that seemed impossible 20 years ago is here and we\\'re like \"but, but...  they aren\\'t profitable enough yet.\" Wright Aeronautical went bankrupt/got bought out too, but I\\'d still say Aviation is kind of a big deal. , So you\\'re calling everyone on this sub pathetic for complaining about Putin?

From then on, both the dish and satellites know where each other are, and  handoff is probably coordinated on the satellite side because they have to schedule time on their radios to beam to the dish. The handoff is seamless though, assuming you have enough satellites in the area and the dish doesn\\'t have any obstructions in the way. , https://youtu.be/QEIUdMiColU\\n\\nGood idea of how it works… , Difference between you and me is your claiming your sure that you are right. \\n\\nI don\\'t.\\n\\nSo if someone is bad faith isn\\'t it you?\\n\\nI mean you could be right. But when trying to unwrap argument like above you often realize that its a lot of assumptions needed to land on those conclusions. , The rescue team aked him to make the sub, and when Musk asked if he should continue working on it closer to the rescue mission, the rescue team leader specifically asked him to keep working on it as a backup plan: **\"It is absolutely worth continuing with the development of this system ... if the rain holds out it may well be used\"** , It looks like you shared an AMP link.

Heard of that, or are you \\'not a scientist\\' enough to not know? , Well, that\\'s a malicious hateful lie. , You sound like elon , Get Elon’s balls out of your mouth so we can hear you better , Okay misinformation peddler , I am not criticising the people of Ukraine, as I have stated many times the help is appreciated, I am criticising other people in this thread who see fit to lick a celebrity\\'s boots. , Meh. That is your moral failing. , Ok got it, I believe that is called ephemeris data and that would make sense. , If you know what you’re saying is unfounded speculative bullshit, you should edit your comments with a little addendum saying “this is all made up baseless nonsense that I invented in my head to defend my idol.”\\n\\nNormally people don’t admit that outright, so good on you I guess. \\n\\nSo why weren’t you able to admit the reality of what happened? It’s okay, I’ll give you another go. Try again. , The rescue team did not originally ask him to make the sub. This is in court testimony and is a fact. \\n\\nThe team leader did, as you said, tell him to keep working on it. Your quote is absolutely correct. Again, **this is the same team leader *I* quoted**, Rick Stanton, who said he was disappointed with Musk\\'s effort, who later testified against Musk in court and who called Musk\\'s visit \"showboating\" at a point when it was clear the sub wouldn\\'t work and said it detracted from the rescue.\\n\\n(Did you actually read the comment you responded to?) , Why do you think they have class 8 limits?  You think they have had weigh stations all over highways and weight enforcement agents because the 33,000 lbs weight limit really doesn\\'t matter at all?   \\n\\nhttps://gray-kfvs12-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/VMt70rZFtdUn3OQBKbF3jVRWCpU=/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(85)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/JZZWNFQ3CFFG7CRL6RBDRJBQBY.jpg\\n\\nWhy do you think bridges have these signs?  Because weight doesn\\'t really matter at all?  It\\'s all make believe and these bridges can magically hold 10 times the weight they were designed to? , Oh!  Why don\\'t you tell me the weight of the batteries in the Tesla Semi.   How about you show me on the tesla site how much the semi weights.  I mean, it\\'s easy to find 0-60 for a semi truck on their website but no mention of it\\'s weight or load capacity. , Once again, I\\'ve never said that. I felt it was pretty obvious by my previous comment, but I\\'ll leave you to figure this one out on your own. , let\\'s make it simpler: musk helped, period. whatever happens next or in the future regarding this particular help he gave to ukraine, then call my attention and remind me i was wrong. do not prophesy.\\n\\nbring your ill-will for musk to other venues, not here becase ukraine needs help---asap. , Now it\\'s not just intolerance of the self-terminating that\\'s a problem, but supporting their loved ones? Who hurt you, dude? , Yeah, ephemeral state. , Stuff I don\\'t know for sure I wrote \"I assume\" before. \\n\\nFor example things you accuse me of knowing. \\n\\nMost of what you are writing is written as facts.\\n\\nWhat you are writing to me  applies more to you than to me. , So you were lying about having 14 published papers on fluid dynamics? Good to know. , You must be a troll. , I believe ephemeral state has to do with app states and ephemeris data is concerning satellite position data. \\n\\nhttps://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/download-definitive-ephemeris , That’s because it’s a fact that his attitude is that of a dime-a-dozen raging insecure little manbaby twitterholic, and that what he said is fucking stupid and malicious and racist and inexcusable. , I\\'ve never claimed to have 14 published papers of any kind. , Nah, just fed up with this website\\'s enabling behavior. , Is that fact or assumptions? \\n\\n:D\\n\\nBlows my mind your  telling me to be factual. , [Really](https://imgur.com/ouIGK5r)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHmmm.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHmmmmmmmmmmmm.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhy would you lie about something literally like 4 posts up thread? , Enabling behavior. What the fuck are you even talking about. You sound like everything I thought texas did. RIP , Fact, thanks for asking. , This is genuinely hilarious. Thanks for demonstrating my point for me. , \"DAE sUiCidE pReVenTiOn is LIterAlLy HItLeR!?!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFucking Reddit moment if I\\'ve ever seen one. You literally advocate for suicide. You know exactly what enabling behavior I\\'m talking about. , So it would not be a dumb thing to take everything you write with a grain of salt. \\n\\nGot ya. , No I don\\'t. I empathize with people who suffer. I guess you can\\'t see that point I tried to make. , You’re utterly incapable of even whispering a single critical view of your cyberdaddy. Everything you say is literally worthless. You start at your conclusion (“daddy muskrat is good”) and work backwards from there on how you can justify it. Your views are fully divorced from observable reality. You’re incapable of doing so much as admitting that baselessly accusing someone of being a pedophile is bad. How is *that* beyond your scope of ability? How are you so far gone that something so plainly malicious and dangerous and atrocious on its face is A-okay as long as daddy is the one doing it? Utterly useless conversation with someone incapable of rational thought. , I empathize with people who suffer too. The moment a person commits suicide that ceases to be them and becomes everyone around them. At least, that\\'s where I\\'m coming from. , Bro, the person who suffers and chooses to take their own life is suffering mentally x10 times. Be greatful you are healthy, mentally and physically. And do not look down upon people who aren\\'t. Even when they choose to take their own life. It might be the best thing for them.'"
