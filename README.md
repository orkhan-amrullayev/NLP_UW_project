In this project I worked with Reddit API to pull the data and used different text mining techniques:

- Using Vader Sentiment Analyzer, taking positive, neutral and negative opinions, visualizing them
- Clustering with PCA and TSNE, using TfidfVectorizer
- Word Embedding with One-hot encoding, tf-idf transformation, Word2Vec.
